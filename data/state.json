First, delete these files and folders in your project:\n\n    * node_modules\n    * package-lock.json\n    * yarn.lock\n\n  Then you need to decide which package manager you prefer to use.\n  We support both npm (https://npmjs.com) and yarn (https://yarnpkg.com/).\n  However, **they can't be used together in one project** so you need to pick one.\n\n  If you decided to use npm, run this in your project directory:\n\n    npm install -g npm@latest\n    npm install\n\n  This should fix your project.\n\n  If you decided to use yarn, update it first (https://yarnpkg.com/en/docs/install).\n  Then run in your project directory:\n\n    yarn\n\n  This should fix your project.\n\n  Importantly, **if you decided to use yarn, you should never run `npm install` in the project**.\n  For example, yarn users should run `yarn add <library>` instead of `npm install <library>`.\n  Otherwise your project will break again.\n\n  Have you done all these steps and still see the issue?\n  Please paste the output of `npm --version` and/or `yarn --version` to confirm.\n-->\n\n(Write your answer here.)\n\n### Which terms did you search for in User Guide?\n\n<!--\n  There are a few common documented problems, such as watcher not detecting changes, or build failing.\n  They are described in the Troubleshooting section of the User Guide:\n\n  https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/troubleshooting\n\n  Please scan these few sections for common problems.\n  Additionally, you can search the User Guide itself for something you're having issues with:\n\n  https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/\n\n  If you didn't find the solution, please share which words you searched for.\n  This helps us improve documentation for future readers who might encounter the same problem.\n-->\n\n(Write your answer here if relevant.)\n\n### Environment\n\n<!--\n  To help identify if a problem is specific to a platform, browser, or module version, information about your environment is required.\n  This enables the maintainers quickly reproduce the issue and give feedback.\n\n  Run the following command in your React app's folder in terminal.\n  Note: The result is copied to your clipboard directly.\n\n  `npx create-react-app --info`\n\n  Paste the output of the command in the section below.\n-->\n\n(paste the output of the command here.)\n\n### Steps to reproduce\n\n<!--\n  How would you describe your issue to someone who doesn’t know you or your project?\n  Try to write a sequence of steps that anybody can repeat to see the issue.\n-->\n\n(Write your steps here:)\n\n1.\n2.\n3.\n\n### Expected behavior\n\n<!--\n  How did you expect the tool to behave?\n  It’s fine if you’re not sure your understanding is correct.\n  Just write down what you thought would happen.\n-->\n\n(Write what you thought would happen.)\n\n### Actual behavior\n\n<!--\n  Did something go wrong?\n  Is something broken, or not behaving as you expected?\n  Please attach screenshots if possible! They are extremely helpful for diagnosing issues.\n-->\n\n(Write what happened. Please add screenshots!)\n\n### Reproducible demo\n\n<!--\n  If you can, please share a project that reproduces the issue.\n  This is the single most effective way to get an issue fixed soon.\n\n  There are two ways to do it:\n\n    * Create a new app and try to reproduce the issue in it.\n      This is useful if you roughly know where the problem is, or can’t share the real code.\n\n    * Or, copy your app and remove things until you’re left with the minimal reproducible demo.\n      This is useful for finding the root cause. You may then optionally create a new project.\n\n  This is a good guide to creating bug demos: https://stackoverflow.com/help/mcve\n  Once you’re done, push the project to GitHub and paste the link to it below:\n-->\n\n(Paste the link to an example project and exact instructions to reproduce the issue.)\n\n<!--\n  What happens if you skip this step?\n\n  We will try to help you, but in many cases it is impossible because crucial\n  information is missing. In that case we'll tag an issue as having a low priority,\n  and eventually close it if there is no clear direction.\n\n  We still appreciate the report though, as eventually somebody else might\n  create a reproducible example for it.\n\n  Thanks for helping us help you!\n-->"

([@XVincentX](https://github.com/XVincentX))\n\n    The generated HTML now includes [Subresource Integrity](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Security/Subresource_Integrity) attributes ensuring that your users aren't served malicious code if your CDN gets compromised.\n\n#### :bug: Bug Fix\n\n- `react-scripts`\n\n  - [#1197](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app/pull/1197) Let Jest handle all file types. ([@gaearon](https://github.com/gaearon))\n\n    Since 0.8.0, we started treating imports of any unknown file extensions as URLs. However, we had to revert this change for the test configuration in 0.8.1 because of a bug causing false positives. In 0.8.2, we are fixing this and making test configuration treat imports with unknown extensions the same way as we do in the browser environment.\n\n  - [#1194](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app/pull/1194) Only honor relative `NODE_PATH`. ([@gaearon](https://github.com/gaearon))\n\n    Historically we have allowed specifying `NODE_PATH` environment variable as a way to allow “absolute imports”. For example, running `NODE_PATH=src npm start` in Bash or `set NODE_PATH=src&&npm start` in Windows Cmd would let you import anything inside `src` without specifying a relative path. However, we found a few nasty edge cases when Node.js core modules end up being in `NODE_PATH` and erroneously become bundled. As a result the build would crash on some systems when some libraries are imported. To fix this, we now only honor relative paths from `NODE_PATH` in Create React App. This means the existing use case for absolute imports is still supported (`src` in the example above is relative), but absolute paths in `NODE_PATH` (such as paths to Node.js core modules) will be ignored.\n\n  - [#1188](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app/pull/1188) Update webpack to fix source map issues. ([@gaearon](https://github.com/gaearon))\n\n    Since 0.8.0, we show source maps in development instead of the compiled code. However, it has come to our attention that webpack's source map implementation had issues interpreting Babel output, and caused source maps to be wrong and breakpoints to be unusable in some cases. webpack has released a fix for this, and we have updated the minimal version of webpack that we are using.\n\n  - [#1180](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app/pull/1180) Use `file-loader` for svgs. ([@bogdansoare](https://github.com/bogdansoare))\n\n    Since 0.8.0, we are treating all imports with non-JS/CSS extensions the same way. Importing them gives you a string with their URL, and if their content is small enough (less than 10K), the URL is in fact an inlined [data URI](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Basics_of_HTTP/Data_URIs). However, this doesn't work well with SVGs in case you use them for a sprite system since fragments don't work in data URIs, and it's wasteful to inline the same sprite SVG many times. To fix this, we have added an exception so that SVG files never get inlined.\n\n- `react-dev-utils`\n\n  - [#1165](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app/pull/1165) Chrome 'open tab' reuse an empty tab when possible. ([@n3tr](https://github.com/n3tr))\n\n    Fixes an issue that caused two tabs to get opened instead of just one. It also fixes some cases where the window with the existing tab would not get activated.\n\n- `babel-preset-react-app`\n\n  - [#1179](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app/pull/1179) Fix Babel issues in tests by applying the right transforms.

We still pin the exact versions in apps that haven't ejected for extra safety.\n\n  - [#1159](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app/pull/1159) Make jsx-no-undef rule an error.

([@fson](https://github.com/fson))\n\n    Yarn is a new fast, reliable and secure alternative to the `npm` client. If you have Yarn installed, `create-react-app` will use it to install packages when you create an app. It also creates a `yarn.lock` file that should be checked into source control (e.g. git). This ensures the same versions of packages will be installed each time `yarn install` is run, on any machine.\n\n    `react-scripts` now also displays instructions using `yarn` commands for projects using Yarn (projects having a `yarn.lock` file).\n\n    To create a project using Yarn, simply install `yarn` and use `create-react-app` like before:\n\n    ```\n    npm install -g yarn create-react-app@latest\n\n    create-react-app my-app  # Packages are now installed with Yarn.\n    ```\n\n#### :boom: Breaking Change\n\n- `babel-preset-react-app`\n\n  - [#902](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app/pull/902) Enable useBuiltIns option on object-rest-spread.

If you are using `babel-preset-react-app` directly in your project _and_ targeting browsers that don't have `Object.assign()` available, from now on you need a polyfill for it (e.g. [`object-assign`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/object-assign)).\n\n    **Note:** `react-scripts` already adds this polyfill, so no changes are necessary in Create React App projects.\n\n#### :bug: Bug Fix\n\n- `react-scripts`\n\n  - [#978](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app/pull/978) Move the remove-on-eject-end tag at the end of the file.

Then, move `index.html` and files it references (such as a favicon) into that folder.\n\nYou can no longer reference any files from `./src` in `index.html`. Instead, `public/index.html` can now only reference files other inside of the `public` folder using a special variable called `%PUBLIC_URL%`.\n\nFor example, instead of:\n\n```html\n<link rel=\"shortcut icon\" href=\"./src/favicon.ico\" />\n```\n\nYou would need to move both `index.html` and `src/favicon.ico` into the `public` folder, and change `<link>` to look like this:\n\n```html\n<link rel=\"shortcut icon\" href=\"%PUBLIC_URL%/favicon.ico\" />\n```\n\nThis ensures it become a part of the build output, and resolves correctly both with client-side routing and non-root `homepage` in `package.json`. Read more about [using the `public` folder](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app/blob/main/packages/react-scripts/template/README.md#using-the-public-folder) and [why these changes were made](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app/pull/703).\n\n## 0.4.3 (September 18, 2016)\n\nThis is a hotfix release for a broken package.<br>\nIt contained no changes to the code.\n\n### Build Dependency (`react-scripts`)\n\n- Fixes a packaging issue that affected npm 2.

([@dceddia](https://github.com/dceddia) in [#552](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app/pull/552))\n\n### Migrating from 0.3.1 to 0.4.0\n\nInside any created project that has not been ejected, run:\n\n```sh\nnpm install --save-dev --save-exact react-scripts@0.4.0\n```\n\n### Breaking Change in 0.4.0\n\nPaths like `/src/somefile.png` used to be served in development, but only by accident. They never worked in production builds. Since 0.4.0, we [don’t serve static files by default in development anymore either](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app/pull/551). This removes a dangerous inconsistency that we never intentionally supported.\n\nIf you need a static file to be part for the build, [import it from JavaScript and you will get its filename](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app/blob/main/template/README.md#adding-images-and-fonts). This ensures it gets included into the production build as well, and its filename contains the content hash.\n\nIf you used static files with `<link href>`, [read this new guide](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app/blob/main/template/README.md#referring-to-static-assets-from-link-href) on how to make sure these files get included into the builds. For example, you can replace `<link href=\"/src/favicons/favicon-32.png\">` with `<link href=\"./src/favicons/favicon-32.png\">`, and then webpack will recognize it and include it into the build.\n\nIf you referenced some other files from `index.html`, please file an issue to discuss your use case. In the meantime, you can serve them from a separate static server until your use case is supported.\n\n## 0.3.1 (September 2, 2016)\n\n### Build Dependency (`react-scripts`)\n\n- Bumps Jest dependency to fix a few issues discovered yesterday.

Now let's see how to update your app to the latest version.\n\n### Migrating from 0.9.5 to 1.0.0\n\nFirst, ensure you are using the latest [Node 6 LTS or newer](https://nodejs.org/en/download/). In 1.0.0, we have dropped support for Node 4 and NPM 2.\n\nInside any created project that has not been ejected, run:\n\n```sh\nnpm install --save-dev --save-exact react-scripts@1.0.0\n```\n\nYou may also optionally update the global command-line utility for bug fixes:\n\n```sh\nnpm install -g create-react-app\n```\n\n#### Ensure application and test files reside in `src/`\n\nWe've never supported importing files from outside `src/`, nor have we supported running tests outside of `src/`.<br>\nWe also never explicitly forbid doing so, which caused confusion when things didn't work like they should.\n\nWhen running or building your application, you may see a message like so:\n\n```sh\nYou attempted to import ... which falls outside of the project src/ directory.\n```\n\nTo remedy this, simply move any files that you `import` within `src/` and update your relative imports accordingly. This enforces that files that `import` each other stay in `src/`, and other folders serve different purposes (e.g. the `public/` folder just gets served from the root).\n\nIf you used relative imports outside the project directory as a way to share code with another project, consider using a [monorepo](https://github.com/lerna/lerna) instead, so that other projects are symlinked to your project's `node_modules/`. Then you can import them as a Node modules.\n\nWhile running `npm test`, you may notice some of your tests are missing. Please move any top-level test directory (i.e. `__test__`, `__spec__`) or files (i.e. `*.test.js`, `*.spec.js`) into `src/`. Conversely, if you have some similarly named files that you _don’t_ want Jest to run, move them outside of `src/`.\n\n#### Import required locales for Moment.js\n\nMoment.js locales are now purposely excluded from the bundle unless explicitly depended on.\n\nPlease import the locales you need:\n\n```js\nimport moment from 'moment';\nimport 'moment/locale/fr';\nimport 'moment/locale/es';\n```\n\n#### You can no longer import file content\n\nYou can no longer import a file and expect to receive its contents as an encoded string.<br>\nThis behavior was confusing and inconsistent depending on the file size.\n\nImporting files with unknown extensions will now always include them into the build and return a valid URL.\n\nIf you'd like to import a file's contents as a string, consider [contributing to #1944](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app/issues/1944).\nFor the time being, you must embed assets within an export:\n\n```js\n// sample.txt\nexport default `i want\nthis data as a string\n`;\n```\n\nYou can then import this as so:\n\n```js\nimport sampleText from './sample.txt';\n\n// ...\n```\n\n#### Confusing window globals can no longer be used without `window` qualifier\n\nPlease prefix any global method with `window.`, you may experience this with methods such as `confirm`.\n\nSimply update references from `confirm` to `window.confirm`.\n\nNote that this new lint error will likely uncover legitimate accidental uses of global variables where you meant to define a local variable instead.\n\n#### Why is my import erroring out?\n\nYou can no longer use AMD import syntax, nor define an import anywhere other than the top of the file.\n\nThis is to reduce confusion around import statements, which do not allow you to evaluate code between them.\n\n#### I see many accessibility warnings\n\nWe have enabled a new set of rules to help make applications more accessible, please take time to learn about the errors and fix them.\n\nYou can search for every lint rule name in the right column and read its description on the web. The fixes are usually very simple.\n\n#### I see many warnings about PropTypes and createClass\n\nWe have enabled the lint warnings about React APIs deprecated in React 15.5.\nYou can automatically convert your project to fix them by running the [corresponding codemods](https://github.com/reactjs/react-codemod).\n\n#### How do I make my tests work with Jest 20?\n\nPlease refer to the [Jest 19](https://facebook.github.io/jest/blog/2017/02/21/jest-19-immersive-watch-mode-test-platform-improvements.html#breaking-changes) and [Jest 20](https://facebook.github.io/jest/blog/2017/05/06/jest-20-delightful-testing-multi-project-runner.html#breaking-changes) breaking changes for migration instructions.\n\nIf you use snapshots, you will likely need to update them once because of the change in format.\n\n#### Flexbox 2009 spec is no longer polyfilled\n\nThe old, 2009 specification for Flexbox is [deprecated and is 2.3x slower than the latest specification](https://developers.google.com/web/tools/lighthouse/audits/old-flexbox).\n\nWe are no longer polyfilling it automatically.\n\n#### I see \"Definition for rule 'jsx-a11y/alt-text' was not found (jsx-a11y/alt-text)\" in the editor\n\nFollow these steps if you see errors about missing lint rules in the editor.\n\n1. Ensure that in your editor ESLint settings you have \"Use Global ESLint\" turned off\n2. Run `npm install` in your project (or `yarn`)\n3. Quit your editor completely (ensure its process doesn't hang around)\n4. Start the editor again\n\nIf you still have the problem please file an issue.\n\n#### Some of my tests started crashing because of unhandled rejections\n\nUnhandled Promise rejections will now crash tests. You can fix them by explicitly catching the errors you don’t care about.\n\n#### How to turn my app into a [Progressive Web App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app/blob/main/packages/react-scripts/template/README.md#making-a-progressive-web-app)?\n\nAfter the regular update procedure above, add these line to `<head>` in `public/index.html`:\n\n```html\n<meta name=\"theme-color\" content=\"#000000\" />\n<!--\n      manifest.json provides metadata used when your web app is added to the\n      homescreen on Android. See https://developers.google.com/web/fundamentals/engage-and-retain/web-app-manifest/\n    -->\n<link rel=\"manifest\" href=\"%PUBLIC_URL%/manifest.json\" />\n```\n\nAdd `<noscript>` to `<body>` in `public/index.html`:\n\n```html\n<noscript> You need to enable JavaScript to run this app. </noscript>\n```\n\nThen create a file called `public/manifest.json` that looks like this:\n\n```js\n{\n  \"short_name\": \"React App\",\n  \"name\": \"Create React App Sample\",\n  \"icons\": [\n    {\n      \"src\": \"favicon.ico\",\n      \"sizes\": \"192x192\",\n      \"type\": \"image/png\"\n    }\n  ],\n  \"start_url\": \"./index.html\",\n  \"display\": \"standalone\",\n  \"theme_color\": \"#000000\",\n  \"background_color\": \"#ffffff\"\n}\n```\n\nFinally, create `src/registerServiceWorker.js` with [this template](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app/blob/bf9eca25f519c73f69cff20ac49ce9500e578fe0/packages/react-scripts/template/src/registerServiceWorker.js), [import it](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app/blob/bf9eca25f519c73f69cff20ac49ce9500e578fe0/packages/react-scripts/template/src/index.js#L4) from `src/index.js` and [call the function it exports](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app/blob/bf9eca25f519c73f69cff20ac49ce9500e578fe0/packages/react-scripts/template/src/index.js#L8).\n\n#### Anything missing?\n\nThis was a large release, and we might have missed something.\n\nPlease [file an issue](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app/issues/new) and we will try to help.\n\n### Detailed Changelog\n\n**For a readable summary of the changes, [check out our blog post](https://facebook.github.io/react/blog/2017/05/18/whats-new-in-create-react-app.html).**\n\n#### :boom: Breaking Change\n\n- `react-dev-utils`, `react-scripts`\n  - [#2189](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app/pull/2189) Add `ModuleScopePlugin` to ensure files reside in `src/`.

Now let's see how to update your app to the latest version in detail.\n\n# Migrating from 1.x to 2.0.3\n\nInside any created project that has not been ejected, run:\n\n```sh\nnpm install --save --save-exact react-scripts@2.0.3\n```\n\nor\n\n```sh\nyarn add --exact react-scripts@2.0.3\n```\n\nIf you previously ejected but now want to upgrade, one common solution is to find the commits where you ejected (and any subsequent commits changing the configuration), revert them, upgrade, and later optionally eject again. It’s also possible that the feature you ejected for (maybe Sass or CSS Modules?) is now supported out of the box. You can find a list of notable new features in the **[Create React App 2.0 blog post](https://reactjs.org/blog/2018/10/01/create-react-app-v2.html)**.\n\n## Breaking Changes\n\nLike any major release, `react-scripts@2.0` contains a few breaking changes. We expect that they won't affect every user, but we recommend to scan over these sections to see if something is relevant to you. If we missed something, please file a new issue.\n\n### Node 6 is no longer supported\n\nPlease upgrade to Node 8 (LTS) or later.\n\n### Polyfills for IE 9, IE 10, and IE 11 are no longer included by default (but you can opt in!)\n\nWe have dropped default support for Internet Explorer 9, 10, and 11. If you still need to support these browsers, follow the instructions below.\n\nFirst, install `react-app-polyfill`:\n\n```sh\nnpm install react-app-polyfill\n```\n\nor\n\n```sh\nyarn add react-app-polyfill\n```\n\nNext, place one of the following lines at the very top of `src/index.js`:\n\n```js\nimport 'react-app-polyfill/ie9'; // For IE 9-11 support\nimport 'react-app-polyfill/ie11'; // For IE 11 support\n```\n\nYou can read more about [these polyfills here](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app/tree/main/packages/react-app-polyfill).\n\n### Dynamic `import()` of a CommonJS module now has a `.default` property\n\n[webpack 4 changed the behavior of `import()`](https://medium.com/webpack/webpack-4-import-and-commonjs-d619d626b655) to be closer in line with the specification.\n\nPreviously, importing a CommonJS module did not require you specify the default export. In most cases, this is now required.\nIf you see errors in your application about `... is not a function`, you likely need to update your dynamic import, e.g.:\n\n```js\nconst throttle = await import('lodash/throttle');\n// replace with\nconst throttle = await import('lodash/throttle').then(m => m.default);\n```\n\n### `require.ensure()` is superseded by dynamic `import()`\n\nWe previously allowed code splitting with a webpack-specific directive, `require.ensure()`. It is now disabled in favor of `import()`. To switch to `import()`, follow the examples below:\n\n**Single Module**\n\n```js\nrequire.ensure(['module-a'], function () {\n  var a = require('module-a');\n  // ...\n});\n\n// Replace with:\nimport('module-a').then(a => {\n  // ...\n});\n```\n\n**Multiple Module**\n\n```js\nrequire.ensure(['module-a', 'module-b'], function () {\n  var a = require('module-a');\n  var b = require('module-b');\n  // ...\n});\n\n// Replace with:\nPromise.all([import('module-a'), import('module-b')]).then(([a, b]) => {\n  // ...\n});\n```\n\n### The default Jest environment was changed to `jsdom`\n\nLook at the `test` entry in the `scripts` section of your `package.json`.\nHere's a table how to change it from \"before\" and \"after\", depending on what you have there:\n\n| 1.x (if you have this...)        | 2.x (...change it to this!)     |\n| -------------------------------- | ------------------------------- |\n| `react-scripts test --env=jsdom` | `react-scripts test`            |\n| `react-scripts test`             | `react-scripts test --env=node` |\n\n### Object `proxy` configuration is superseded by `src/setupProxy.js`\n\nTo check if action is required, look for the `proxy` key in `package.json` and follow this table:\n\n1. I couldn't find a `proxy` key in `package.json`\n   - No action is required!\n2. The value of `proxy` is a string (e.g. `http://localhost:5000`)\n   - No action is required!\n3. The value of `proxy` is an object\n   - Follow the migration instructions below.\n\n**It's worth highlighting: if your `proxy` field is a `string`, e.g. `http://localhost:5000`, or you don't have it, skip this section. This feature is still supported and has the same behavior.**\n\nIf your `proxy` is an object, that means you are using the advanced proxy configuration. It has become fully customizable so we removed the limited support for the object-style configuration. Here's how to recreate it.\n\nFirst, install `http-proxy-middleware` using npm or Yarn:\n\n```sh\nnpm install http-proxy-middleware\n```\n\nor\n\n```sh\nyarn add http-proxy-middleware\n```\n\nNext, create `src/setupProxy.js` and place the following contents in it:\n\n```js\nconst proxy = require('http-proxy-middleware');\n\nmodule.exports = function (app) {\n  // ...\n};\n```\n\nNow, migrate each entry in your `proxy` object one by one, e.g.:\n\n```json\n\"proxy\": {\n  \"/api\": {\n    \"target\": \"http://localhost:5000/\"\n    },\n  \"/*.svg\": {\n    \"target\": \"http://localhost:5000/\"\n  }\n}\n```\n\nPlace entries into `src/setupProxy.js` like so:\n\n```js\nconst proxy = require('http-proxy-middleware');\n\nmodule.exports = function (app) {\n  app.use(proxy('/api', { target: 'http://localhost:5000/' }));\n  app.use(proxy('/*.svg', { target: 'http://localhost:5000/' }));\n};\n```\n\nYou can also use completely custom logic there now! This wasn't possible before.\n\n### `.mjs` file extension support is removed\n\nChange the extension of any files in your project using `.mjs` to just `.js`.\n\nIt was removed because of inconsistent support from underlying tools. We will add it back after it stops being experimental, and Jest gets built-in support for it.\n\n### `PropTypes` definitions are now removed in production\n\nNormally, this shouldn't affect your logic and should make the resulting bundle smaller. However, you may be relying on PropTypes definition for production logic. This is not recommended, and will break now. If a library does it, one possible solution is to file an issue in it with a proposal to use a different field (not `propTypes`) to signal that the declaration needs to be retained.\n\n### Anything missing?\n\nThis was a large release, and we might have missed something.\n\nPlease [file an issue](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app/issues/new) and we will try to help.\n\n# Migrating from 2.0.0-next.xyz\n\nIf you used 2.x alphas, please [follow these instructions](https://gist.github.com/gaearon/8650d1c70e436e5eff01f396dffc4114).\n\n# Detailed Changelog\n\n**For a readable summary of the changes, [check out our blog post](https://reactjs.org/blog/2018/10/01/create-react-app-v2.html).**\n\n#### :rocket: New Feature\n\n- `react-scripts`\n  -

For TypeScript users, we're deprecating `--typescript` in favour of `--template typescript`.\n\nIf you don't set a template, we'll create your new app with `cra-template` - which is just a new name for our base template.\n\n### Optional Chaining and Nullish Coalescing Operators\n\nWe now support the [optional chaining](https://github.com/TC39/proposal-optional-chaining) and [nullish coalescing](https://github.com/tc39/proposal-nullish-coalescing) operators!\n\n```js\n// Optional chaining\na?.(); // undefined if `a` is null/undefined\nb?.c; // undefined if `b` is null/undefined\n\n// Nullish coalescing\nundefined ?? 'some other default'; // result: 'some other default'\nnull ?? 'some other default'; // result: 'some other default'\n'' ?? 'some other default'; // result: ''\n0 ?? 300; // result: 0\nfalse ?? true; // result: false\n```\n\n**If you're using TypeScript, you will need to upgrade your `typescript` dependency to `3.7.0` or later if you wish to use the new operators.**\n\n**If you're using Visual Studio Code 1.40 (the latest as of this release) or earlier, you will need to configure your editor if you want it to understand the new operators.**\n\nIf you're using TypeScript in your project and have already upgrade its version as described above, then you can [configure VS Code to `Use Workspace Version` of TypeScript](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/typescript/typescript-compiling#_using-newer-typescript-versions). If your project isn't using TypeScript, you can use the [JavaScript and TypeScript Nightly extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-vscode.vscode-typescript-next) until VS Code releases a newer version including TypeScript `3.7.0` or newer.\n\n### Numeric Separators\n\nWe've added support for [numeric separators](https://github.com/tc39/proposal-numeric-separator) to improve readability of numeric literals.\n\n```js\n1000000000; // Is this a billion? a hundred millions? Ten millions?\n101475938.38; // what scale is this? what power of 10?\n\n1_000_000_000; // Ah, so a billion\n101_475_938.38; // And this is hundreds of millions\n```\n\n### no-unexpected-multiline\n\nWe've removed this rule as it is not compatible with Prettier. If you rely on this rule you can re-enable it by [extending our ESLint config](https://create-react-app.dev/docs/setting-up-your-editor/#experimental-extending-the-eslint-config) and adding the following:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"extends\": \"react-app\",\n  \"rules\": {\n    \"no-unexpected-multiline\": \"warn\"\n  }\n}\n```\n\n#### :rocket: New Feature\n\n- `babel-preset-react-app`\n  - [#7438](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app/pull/7438) Add optional chaining and nullish coalescing operators support ([@renatoagds](https://github.com/renatoagds))\n- `babel-preset-react-app`, `react-dev-utils`\n  - [#7817](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app/pull/7817) Add numeric separator support ([@tharun208](https://github.com/tharun208))\n- `cra-template-typescript`, `cra-template`, `create-react-app`, `react-scripts`\n  - [#7716](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app/pull/7716) Add template support ([@mrmckeb](https://github.com/mrmckeb))\n\n#### :boom: Breaking Change\n\n- `create-react-app`, `react-dev-utils`, `react-scripts`\n\n  - [#7988](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app/pull/7988) Bump webpack-dev-server ([@ianschmitz](https://github.com/ianschmitz))\n\n    **NOTE: This is only a breaking change if you're using `react-dev-utils` outside of Create React App.**\n\n#### :bug: Bug Fix\n\n- `eslint-config-react-app`\n  - [#8039](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app/pull/8039) Remove no-unexpected-multiline rule ([@iansu](https://github.com/iansu))\n- `create-react-app`\n  - [#7991](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app/pull/7991) Support templates in scoped packages ([@klasbj](https://github.com/klasbj))\n  - [#7839](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app/pull/7839) added check for typescript template and unsupported node version ([@awaseem](https://github.com/awaseem))\n- `react-scripts`\n  - [#7860](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app/pull/7860) Mark TypeScript as an optional peer dependency for react-scripts ([@dstaley](https://github.com/dstaley))\n  - [#7822](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app/pull/7822) Fix absolute paths issue in Jest ([@rovansteen](https://github.com/rovansteen))\n  - [#7796](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app/pull/7796) Fixed process type in TypeScript template.

It’s also possible that the feature you ejected for is now supported out of the box.\n\n## Breaking Changes\n\nLike any major release, `react-scripts@3.0.0` contains a few breaking changes. We expect that they won't affect every user, but we recommend you look over this section to see if something is relevant to you. If we missed something, please file a new issue.\n\n### Jest 24\n\nWe've updated from Jest 23 to get the latest improvements in Jest 24. We've noticed some differences in snapshot serialization in Jest 24, so you may need to adjust your tests slightly once you update. You can read more about what's changed in the [Jest 24 blog post](https://jestjs.io/blog/2019/01/25/jest-24-refreshing-polished-typescript-friendly).\n\n### Hooks support\n\nWe now enforce [Rules of Hooks](https://reactjs.org/docs/hooks-rules.html) with `eslint-plugin-react-hooks`. If you are breaking any of the rules of Hooks this will cause your build to fail.\n\n### TypeScript linting\n\nWe now lint TypeScript files. You can see the list of [rules we enforce](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app/blob/eee8491d57d67dd76f0806a7512eaba2ce9c36f0/packages/eslint-config-react-app/index.js#L89:L98) to check if your project is compatible. If you're using Visual Studio Code you can follow our guide to [setup up your editor to display lint warnings](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/setting-up-your-editor#displaying-lint-output-in-the-editor).\n\n### `browserslist` support in @babel/preset-env\n\nThe `browserslist` config in your `package.json` is now used to control the output of your JavaScript files. You can use separate configuration for `development` and `production`. See [here](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app/blob/b0cbf2caa18ee8267855b14578ebc3dee826f552/packages/react-scripts/package.json#L83-L94) for a good starting point which gives a good development experience, especially when using language features such as async/await, but still provides high compatibility with many browsers in production\n\n### Remove --no-watch flag\n\nWe've removed the `--no-watch` flag from the `start` script in favor of Jest's own `--watchAll=false`.\n\n### New structure in `asset-manifest.json`\n\nAll asset paths have been moved under the `files` key in `asset-manifest.json`.\n\n## New Features\n\n### using `jsconfig.json`/`tsconfig.json`\n\nWe now support setting `baseUrl` in `jsconfig.json` and `tsconfig.json`. To configure `baseUrl` to point to the `src` directory in your JavaScript project, create a `jsconfig.json` file in your project root:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"compilerOptions\": {\n    \"baseUrl\": \"src\"\n  },\n  \"include\": [\"src\"]\n}\n```\n\nIf you have a TypeScript project you can configure `baseUrl` the same way in your `tsconfig.json`.\n\nCurrently the only supported options for `baseUrl` are `node_modules` (the default) and `src`.\n\n### PostCSS Normalize\n\nYou can now include a version of Normalize.css in your project that will use your `browserslist` setting to generate the appropriate styles for your target browsers. To include it simply add `@import-normalize` at the top of one of your CSS files.\n\n# Detailed Changelog\n\n#### :rocket: New Feature\n\n- `react-scripts`\n  - [#6656](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app/pull/6656) Set baseUrl from jsconfig.json/tsconfig.json ([@rovansteen](https://github.com/rovansteen))\n  - [#5810](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app/pull/5810) Adds PostCSS Normalize ([@mrchief](https://github.com/mrchief))\n- `babel-plugin-named-asset-import`, `confusing-browser-globals`, `react-dev-utils`, `react-error-overlay`, `react-scripts`\n  - [#6278](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app/pull/6278) Update to Jest 24 ([@loryman](https://github.com/loryman))\n- `eslint-config-react-app`, `react-scripts`\n  - [#6513](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app/pull/6513) Add TypeScript linting support ([@ianschmitz](https://github.com/ianschmitz))\n- `babel-preset-react-app`, `eslint-config-react-app`, `react-scripts`\n  - [#5997](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app/pull/5997) Support React Hooks (#5602) ([@eivind88](https://github.com/eivind88))\n- `babel-preset-react-app`, `react-dev-utils`, `react-scripts`\n  - [#6608](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app/pull/6608) Support browserslist in @babel/preset-env ([@ianschmitz](https://github.com/ianschmitz))\n\n#### :boom: Breaking Change\n\n- `react-scripts`\n  - [#6848](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app/pull/6848) Remove no-watch flag in favor of watchAll=false ([@bugzpodder](https://github.com/bugzpodder))\n  - [#6821](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app/pull/6821) Add custom function to generate asset manifest ([@iansu](https://github.com/iansu))\n  - [#6750](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app/pull/6750) change NODE_ENV and PUBLIC_URL into readonly ([@xiaoxiangmoe](https://github.com/xiaoxiangmoe))\n  - [#4176](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app/pull/4176) Remove --coverage + --watch workaround for the test command ([@stipsan](https://github.com/stipsan))\n  - [#6615](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app/pull/6615) Allow .json type checking ([@ianschmitz](https://github.com/ianschmitz))\n  - [#6821](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app/pull/6821) Add custom function to generate asset manifest ([@iansu](https://github.com/iansu))\n- `babel-preset-react-app`, `react-app-polyfill`\n  - [#6769](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app/pull/6769) Update to core-js@3 ([@ianschmitz](https://github.com/ianschmitz))\n- `babel-plugin-named-asset-import`, `confusing-browser-globals`, `react-dev-utils`, `react-error-overlay`, `react-scripts`\n  - [#6278](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app/pull/6278) Update to Jest 24 ([@loryman](https://github.com/loryman))\n- `eslint-config-react-app`, `react-scripts`\n  - [#6513](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app/pull/6513) Add TypeScript linting support ([@ianschmitz](https://github.com/ianschmitz))\n- `babel-preset-react-app`, `eslint-config-react-app`, `react-scripts`\n  - [#5997](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app/pull/5997) Support React Hooks (#5602) ([@eivind88](https://github.com/eivind88))\n- `babel-preset-react-app`, `react-dev-utils`, `react-scripts`\n  - [#6608](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app/pull/6608) Support browserslist in @babel/preset-env ([@ianschmitz](https://github.com/ianschmitz))\n\n#### :bug: Bug Fix\n\n- `react-dev-utils`\n  - [#6735](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app/pull/6735) InlineChunkHtmlPlugin works with empty publicPath ([@ItalyPaleAle](https://github.com/ItalyPaleAle))\n- `react-scripts`\n  - [#6732](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app/pull/6732) fix: terser-webpack-plugin hanging on WSL ([@endiliey](https://github.com/endiliey))\n  - [#6610](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app/pull/6610) Convert JSON.stringify \\n to os.EOL ([@MikeBeaton](https://github.com/MikeBeaton))\n- `create-react-app`\n  - [#6759](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app/pull/6759) Fix unlogged yarn pnp message ([@heyimalex](https://github.com/heyimalex))\n\n#### :nail_care: Enhancement\n\n- `react-scripts`\n  - [#6845](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app/pull/6845) Change CRA version in `react-scripts` eject warning.

It’s also possible that the feature you ejected for is now supported out of the box.\n\n## Breaking Changes\n\nLike any major release, `react-scripts@4.0.0` contains a number of breaking changes. We expect that they won't affect every user, but we recommend you look over this section to see if something is relevant to you. If we missed something, please file a new issue.\n\n### ESLint\n\nWe've upgraded to ESLint 7 and added many new rules including some for Jest and React Testing Library as well as the `import/no-anonymous-default-export` rule. We've also upgraded `eslint-plugin-hooks` to version 4.0.0 and removed the `EXTEND_ESLINT` flag as it is no longer required to customize the ESLint config.\n\n### Jest\n\nWe've upgraded to Jest 26 and now set `resetMocks` to `true` by default in the Jest config.\n\n### Service workers\n\nWe've switched to the Workbox InjectManifest plugin and moved the PWA templates into their own [repository](https://github.com/cra-template/pwa).\n\n### Removed `typescript` flag and `NODE_PATH` support\n\nWe've removed the deprecated `typescript` flag when creating a new app. Use `--template typescript` instead. We've also dropped deprecated `NODE_PATH` flag as this has been replaced by setting the base path in `jsconfig.json`.\n\n### Fix dotenv file loading order\n\nWe've changed the loading order of env files to match the `dotenv` specification. See #9037 for more details.\n\n### Dropped Node 8 support\n\nNode 8 reached End-of-Life at the end of 2019 and is no longer supported.\n\n# Detailed Changelog\n\n#### :rocket: New Feature\n\n- `eslint-config-react-app`, `react-error-overlay`, `react-scripts`\n  - [#8963](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app/pull/8963) feat(eslint-config-react-app): Add jest & testing-library rules ([@MichaelDeBoey](https://github.com/MichaelDeBoey))\n- `react-scripts`\n  - [#9611](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app/pull/9611) Add AVIF image support ([@Hongbo-Miao](https://github.com/Hongbo-Miao))\n  - [#9114](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app/pull/9114) Allow testMatch for jest config ([@Favna](https://github.com/Favna))\n  - [#8790](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app/pull/8790) Add back in --stats output from webpack.

        "content": "# Contributing to Create React App\n\nLoving Create React App and want to get involved? Thanks! There are plenty of ways you can help.\n\nPlease take a moment to review this document in order to make the contribution process straightforward and effective for everyone involved.\n\nFollowing these guidelines helps to communicate that you respect the time of the developers managing and developing this open source project. In return, they should reciprocate that respect in addressing your issue or assessing patches and features.\n\n## Core Ideas\n\nAs much as possible, we try to avoid adding configuration and flags. The purpose of this tool is to provide the best experience for people getting started with React, and this will always be our first priority. This means that sometimes we [sacrifice additional functionality](https://gettingreal.37signals.com/ch05_Half_Not_Half_Assed.php) (such as server rendering) because it is too hard to solve it in a way that wouldn’t require any configuration.\n\nWe prefer **convention, heuristics, or interactivity** over configuration.<br>\nHere are a few examples of them in action.\n\n### Convention\n\n<!--alex disable easy-->\n\nInstead of letting the user specify the entry filename, we always assume it to be `src/index.js`. Rather than letting the user specify the output bundle name, we generate it, but make sure to include the content hash in it. Whenever possible, we want to leverage convention to make good choices for the user, especially in cases where it’s easy to misconfigure something.\n\n### Heuristics\n\nNormally, `npm start` runs on port `3000`, and this is not explicitly configurable. However, some environments like cloud IDEs want the programs to run on a specific port to serve their output. We want to play well with different environments, so Create React App reads `PORT` environment variable and prefers it when it is specified. The trick is that we know cloud IDEs already specify it automatically, so there is no need for the user to do anything. Create React App relies on heuristics to do the right thing depending on environment.\n\n<!--alex disable just-->\n\nAnother example of this is how `npm test` normally launches the watcher, but if the `CI` environment variable is set, it will run tests once. We know that popular CI environments set this variable, so the user doesn’t need to do anything. It just works.\n\n### Interactivity\n\nWe prefer to add interactivity to the command line interface rather than add configuration flags. For example, `npm start` will attempt to run with port `3000` by default, but it may be busy. Many other tools fail in this case and ask that you pass a different port, but Create React App will display a prompt asking if you’d like to run the app on the next available port.\n\nAnother example of interactivity is `npm test` watcher interface. Instead of asking people to pass command line flags for switching between test runner modes or search patterns, we print a hint with keys that you can press during the test session to instruct watcher what to do. Jest supports both flags and interactive CLI but Create React App prefers long-running sessions to keep user immersed in the flow over short-running sessions with different flags.\n\n### Breaking the Rules\n\nNo rules are perfect. Sometimes we may introduce flags or configuration if we believe the value is high enough to justify the complexity. For example, we know that apps may be hosted paths different from the root, and we need to support this use case. However, we still try to fall back to heuristics when possible. In this example, we ask that you specify `homepage` in `package.json`, and infer the correct path based on it. We also nudge the user to fill out the `homepage` after the build, so the user becomes aware that the feature exists.\n\n## Submitting a Pull Request\n\nGood pull requests, such as patches, improvements, and new features, are a fantastic help. They should remain focused in scope and avoid containing unrelated commits.\n\nPlease **ask first** if somebody else is already working on this or the core developers think your feature is in-scope for Create React App. Generally always have a related issue with discussions for whatever you are including.\n\nPlease also provide a **test plan**, i.e. specify how you verified that your addition works.\n\n## Folder Structure of Create React App\n\n`create-react-app` is a monorepo, meaning it is divided into independent sub-packages.<br>\nThese packages can be found in the [`packages/`](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app/tree/main/packages) directory.\n\n### Overview of directory structure\n\n```\npackages/\n  babel-plugin-named-asset-import/\n  babel-preset-react-app/\n  confusing-browser-globals/\n  cra-template/\n  cra-template-typescript/\n  create-react-app/\n  eslint-config-react-app/\n  react-app-polyfill/\n  react-dev-utils/\n  react-error-overlay/\n  react-scripts/\n```\n\n### Package Descriptions\n\n#### [babel-preset-react-app](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app/tree/main/packages/babel-preset-react-app)\n\nThis package is a babel preset intended to be used with `react-scripts`.<br>\nIt targets platforms that React is designed to support (IE 11+) and enables experimental features used heavily at Facebook.<br>\nThis package is enabled by default for all `create-react-app` scaffolded applications.\n\n#### [create-react-app](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app/tree/main/packages/create-react-app)\n\nThe global CLI command code can be found in this directory, and shouldn't often be changed. It should run on Node 0.10+.\n\n#### [eslint-config-react-app](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app/tree/main/packages/eslint-config-react-app)\n\nThis package contains a conservative set of rules focused on making errors apparent and enforces no style rules.<br>\nThis package is enabled by default for all `create-react-app` scaffolded applications.\n\n#### [react-dev-utils](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app/tree/main/packages/react-dev-utils)\n\nThis package contains utilities used for `react-scripts` and sibling packages.<br>\nIts main purpose is to conceal code which the user shouldn't be burdened with upon ejecting.\n\n#### [react-scripts](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app/tree/main/packages/react-scripts)\n\nThis package is the heart of the project, which contains the scripts for setting up the development server, building production builds, configuring all software used, etc.<br>\nAll functionality must be retained (and configuration given to the user) if they choose to eject.\n\n## Setting Up a Local Copy\n\nYou will need `npm@7` and `yarn@1` in order to bootstrap and test a local copy of this repo.\n\n1. Clone the repo with `git clone https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app`\n\n2. Run `npm install` in the root `create-react-app` folder.\n\nOnce it is done, you can modify any file locally and run `npm start`, `npm test` or `npm run build` like you can in a generated project. It will serve the application from the files located in `packages/cra-template/template`.\n\nIf you want to try out the end-to-end flow with the global CLI, you can do this too:\n\n```sh\nnpx create-react-app my-app\ncd my-app\n```\n\nand then run `npm start` or `npm run build`.\n\n## Contributing to E2E (end to end) tests\n\n**TL;DR** use the command `npm run e2e:docker` to run unit and e2e tests.\n\nMore detailed information are in the dedicated [README](/test/README.md).\n\n### CI testing with private packages\n\n**create-react-app** relies on main registry to fetch all dependencies, but, if you are in the need to usage of custom private packages that need to be fetch while running E2E test you might need a different configuration.\n\n#### Customizing E2E registry configuration\n\nWe use [verdaccio](https://github.com/verdaccio/verdaccio) to emulate packages publishing in a registry using a default configuration. You might modify the current behaviour by editing the file `task/verdaccio.yaml`.\n\nFor more information about the configuration check out the [Verdaccio documentation](https://verdaccio.org/docs/en/configuration).\n\n## Tips for contributors using Windows\n\nThe scripts in tasks folder and other scripts in `package.json` will not work in Windows out of the box. However, using [Bash on windows](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/commandline/wsl/about) makes it easier to use those scripts without any workarounds. The steps to do so are detailed below:\n\n### Install Bash on Ubuntu on Windows\n\nA good step by step guide can be found [here](https://www.howtogeek.com/249966/how-to-install-and-use-the-linux-bash-shell-on-windows-10/)\n\n### Install Node.js and yarn\n\nEven if you have node and yarn installed on your windows, it would not be accessible from the bash shell. You would have to install it again. Installing via [`nvm`](https://github.com/creationix/nvm#install-script) is recommended.\n\n### Line endings\n\nBy default git would use `CRLF` line endings which would cause the scripts to fail. You can change it for this repo only by setting `autocrlf` to false by running `git config core.autocrlf false`. You can also enable it for all your repos by using the `--global` flag if you wish to do so.\n\n## Cutting a Release\n\n1. Tag all merged pull requests that go into the release with the relevant milestone. Each merged PR should also be labeled with one of the [labels](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app/labels) named `tag: ...` to indicate what kind of change it is. **Make sure all breaking changes are correctly labelled with `tag: breaking change`.**\n2. Close the milestone and create a new one for the next release.\n3. In most releases, only `react-scripts` needs to be released. If you don’t have any changes to the `packages/create-react-app` folder, you don’t need to bump its version or publish it (the publish script will publish only changed packages).\n4. Note that files in `packages/create-react-app` should be modified with extreme caution. Since it’s a global CLI, any version of `create-react-app` (global CLI) including very old ones should work with the latest version of `react-scripts`.\n5. Pull the latest changes from GitHub, run `npm ci`.\n6. Create a change log entry for the release:\n\n- You'll need an [access token for the GitHub API](https://help.github.com/articles/creating-an-access-token-for-command-line-use/). Save it to this environment variable: `export GITHUB_AUTH=\"...\"`\n- Run `npm run changelog`. The command will find all the labeled pull requests merged since the last release and group them by the label and affected packages, and create a change log entry with all the changes and links to PRs and their authors. Copy and paste it to `CHANGELOG.md`.\n- Add a four-space indented paragraph after each non-trivial list item, explaining what changed and why. For each breaking change also write who it affects and instructions for migrating existing code.\n- Maybe add some newlines here and there. Preview the result on GitHub to get a feel for it. Changelog generator output is a bit too terse for my taste, so try to make it visually pleasing and well grouped.\n\n7. Make sure to include “Migrating from ...” instructions for the previous release. Often you can copy and paste them.\n8. Run `npm run publish`. (It has to be `npm run publish` exactly, not `npm publish` or `yarn publish`.)\n9. Wait for a long time, and it will get published. Don’t worry that it’s stuck. In the end the publish script will prompt for versions before publishing the packages.\n10. After publishing, create a GitHub Release with the same text as the changelog entry. See previous Releases for inspiration.\n\nMake sure to test the released version! If you want to be extra careful, you can publish a prerelease by running `npm run publish -- --canary --exact --preid next --dist-tag=next --force-publish=* minor` instead of `npm run publish`.\n\n## Releasing the Docs\n\n1. Go to the `docusaurus/website` directory\n2. Run `npm ci`\n3. Run `npm run build`\n4. You'll need an [access token for the GitHub API](https://help.github.com/articles/creating-an-access-token-for-command-line-use/). Save it to this environment variable: `export GITHUB_AUTH=\"...\"`\n5. Run `GIT_USER=<GITHUB_USERNAME> CURRENT_BRANCH=main USE_SSH=true npm run deploy`\n\n---\n\n_Many thanks to [h5bp](https://github.com/h5bp/html5-boilerplate/blob/master/.github/CONTRIBUTING.md) for the inspiration with this contributing guide_"

It uses webpack, Babel, ESLint, and other amazing projects, but provides a cohesive curated experience on top of them.\n\n- **No Configuration Required:** You don't need to configure anything. A reasonably good configuration of both development and production builds is handled for you so you can focus on writing code.\n\n- **No Lock-In:** You can “eject” to a custom setup at any time. Run a single command, and all the configuration and build dependencies will be moved directly into your project, so you can pick up right where you left off.\n\n## What’s Included?\n\nYour environment will have everything you need to build a modern single-page React app:\n\n- React, JSX, ES6, TypeScript and Flow syntax support.\n- Language extras beyond ES6 like the object spread operator.\n- Autoprefixed CSS, so you don’t need `-webkit-` or other prefixes.\n- A fast interactive unit test runner with built-in support for coverage reporting.\n- A live development server that warns about common mistakes.\n- A build script to bundle JS, CSS, and images for production, with hashes and sourcemaps.\n- An offline-first [service worker](https://developers.google.com/web/fundamentals/getting-started/primers/service-workers) and a [web app manifest](https://developers.google.com/web/fundamentals/engage-and-retain/web-app-manifest/), meeting all the [Progressive Web App](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/making-a-progressive-web-app) criteria. (_Note: Using the service worker is opt-in as of `react-scripts@2.0.0` and higher_)\n- Hassle-free updates for the above tools with a single dependency.\n\nCheck out [this guide](https://github.com/nitishdayal/cra_closer_look) for an overview of how these tools fit together.\n\nThe tradeoff is that **these tools are preconfigured to work in a specific way**. If your project needs more customization, you can [\"eject\"](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/available-scripts#npm-run-eject) and customize it, but then you will need to maintain this configuration.\n\n## Popular Alternatives\n\nCreate React App is a great fit for:\n\n- **Learning React** in a comfortable and feature-rich development environment.\n- **Starting new single-page React applications.**\n- **Creating examples** with React for your libraries and components.\n\nHere are a few common cases where you might want to try something else:\n\n- If you want to **try React** without hundreds of transitive build tool dependencies, consider [using a single HTML file or an online sandbox instead](https://reactjs.org/docs/getting-started.html#try-react).\n\n- If you need to **integrate React code with a server-side template framework** like Rails, Django or Symfony, or if you’re **not building a single-page app**, consider using [nwb](https://github.com/insin/nwb), or [Neutrino](https://neutrino.js.org/) which are more flexible. For Rails specifically, you can use [Rails Webpacker](https://github.com/rails/webpacker). For Symfony, try [Symfony's webpack Encore](https://symfony.com/doc/current/frontend/encore/reactjs.html).\n\n- If you need to **publish a React component**, [nwb](https://github.com/insin/nwb) can [also do this](https://github.com/insin/nwb#react-components-and-libraries), as well as [Neutrino's react-components preset](https://neutrino.js.org/packages/react-components/).\n\n- If you want to do **server rendering** with React and Node.js, check out [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) or [Razzle](https://github.com/jaredpalmer/razzle). Create React App is agnostic of the backend, and only produces static HTML/JS/CSS bundles.\n\n- If your website is **mostly static** (for example, a portfolio or a blog), consider using [Gatsby](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/) or [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/). Unlike Create React App, Gatsby pre-renders the website into HTML at build time. Next.js supports both server rendering and pre-rendering.\n\n- Finally, if you need **more customization**, check out [Neutrino](https://neutrino.js.org/) and its [React preset](https://neutrino.js.org/packages/react/).\n\nAll of the above tools can work with little to no configuration.\n\nIf you prefer configuring the build yourself, [follow this guide](https://reactjs.org/docs/add-react-to-a-website.html).\n\n## React Native\n\nLooking for something similar, but for React Native?<br>\nCheck out [Expo CLI](https://github.com/expo/expo-cli).\n\n## Contributing\n\nWe'd love to have your helping hand on `create-react-app`!

CSS Modules allows the scoping of CSS by automatically creating a unique classname of the format `[filename]\\_[classname]\\_\\_[hash]`.\n\n> **Tip:** Should you want to preprocess a stylesheet with Sass then make sure to [follow the installation instructions](adding-a-sass-stylesheet.md) and then change the stylesheet file extension as follows: `[name].module.scss` or `[name].module.sass`.\n\nCSS Modules let you use the same CSS class name in different files without worrying about naming clashes.

For example, instead of using a `.Button` CSS class in `<AcceptButton>` and `<RejectButton>` components, we recommend creating a `<Button>` component with its own `.Button` styles, that both `<AcceptButton>` and `<RejectButton>` can render (but [not inherit](https://facebook.github.io/react/docs/composition-vs-inheritance.html)).\n\nFollowing this rule often makes CSS preprocessors less useful, as features like mixins and nesting are replaced by component composition. You can, however, integrate a CSS preprocessor if you find it valuable.\n\nTo use Sass, first install `sass`:\n\n```sh\n$ npm install sass\n# or\n$ yarn add sass\n```\n\nNow you can rename `src/App.css` to `src/App.scss` and update `src/App.js` to import `src/App.scss`.\nThis file and any other file will be automatically compiled if imported with the extension `.scss` or `.sass`.\n\nTo share variables between Sass files, you can use Sass's [`@use` rule](https://sass-lang.com/documentation/at-rules/use). For example, `src/App.scss` and other component style files could include `@use \"./shared.scss\";` with variable definitions.\n\nThis will allow you to do imports like\n\n```scss\n@use 'styles/_colors.scss'; // assuming a styles directory under src/\n@use '~nprogress/nprogress'; // loading a css file from the nprogress node module\n```\n\n> **Note:** You can prefix paths with `~`, as displayed above, to resolve modules from `node_modules`.\n\n`sass` also supports the `SASS_PATH` variable.\n\nTo use imports relative to a path you specify, you can add a [`.env` file](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app/blob/main/docusaurus/docs/adding-custom-environment-variables.md#adding-development-environment-variables-in-env) at the project root with the path specified in the `SASS_PATH` environment variable.

You will also need to include the `module.file_ext` default settings for `.js`, `.jsx`, `.mjs` and `.json` files.\n>\n> ```\n> [options]\n> module.file_ext=.js\n> module.file_ext=.jsx\n> module.file_ext=.mjs\n> module.file_ext=.json\n> module.file_ext=.sass\n> module.file_ext=.scss\n> ```\n\n> **Note:** LibSass and the packages built on top of it, including Node Sass, are [deprecated](https://sass-lang.com/blog/libsass-is-deprecated).\n> If you're a user of Node Sass, you can migrate to Dart Sass by replacing `node-sass` in your `package.json` file with `sass` or by running the following commands:\n>\n> ```sh\n> $ npm uninstall node-sass\n> $ npm install sass\n> # or\n> $ yarn remove node-sass\n> $ yarn add sass\n> ```"

To express that a JavaScript file depends on a CSS file, you need to **import the CSS from the JavaScript file**:\n\n## `Button.css`\n\n```css\n.Button {\n  padding: 20px;\n}\n```\n\n## `Button.js`\n\n```js\nimport React, { Component } from 'react';\nimport './Button.css'; // Tell webpack that Button.js uses these styles\n\nclass Button extends Component {\n  render() {\n    // You can use them as regular CSS styles\n    return <div className=\"Button\" />;\n  }\n}\n```\n\n**This is not required for React** but many people find this feature convenient. You can read about the benefits of this approach [here](https://medium.com/seek-blog/block-element-modifying-your-javascript-components-d7f99fcab52b). However you should be aware that this makes your code less portable to other build tools and environments than webpack.\n\nIn development, expressing dependencies this way allows your styles to be reloaded on the fly as you edit them. In production, all CSS files will be concatenated into a single minified `.css` file in the build output.\n\nIf you are concerned about using webpack-specific semantics, you can put all your CSS right into `src/index.css`. It would still be imported from `src/index.js`, but you could always remove that import if you later migrate to a different build tool."

[React Bootstrap](https://react-bootstrap.netlify.com/) is the most popular option that strives for complete parity with Bootstrap. [reactstrap](https://reactstrap.github.io/) is also a good choice for projects looking for smaller builds at the expense of some features.\n\nEach project's respective documentation site has detailed instructions for installing and using them. Both depend on the Bootstrap css file so install that as well:\n\n```sh\nnpm install bootstrap\n```\n\nAlternatively you may use `yarn`:\n\n```sh\nyarn add bootstrap\n```\n\nImport Bootstrap CSS and optionally Bootstrap theme CSS in the beginning of your `src/index.js` file:\n\n```js\nimport 'bootstrap/dist/css/bootstrap.css';\n// Put any other imports below so that CSS from your\n// components takes precedence over default styles.\n```\n\n## Using a Custom Theme\n\n> Note: this feature is available with `react-scripts@2.0.0` and higher.\n\nSometimes you might need to tweak the visual styles of Bootstrap (or equivalent package).\n\nAs of `react-scripts@2.0.0` you can import `.scss` files. This makes it possible to use a package's built-in Sass variables for global style preferences.\n\nTo enable `scss` in Create React App you will need to install `sass`.\n\n```sh\nnpm install sass\n```\n\nAlternatively you may use `yarn`:\n\n```sh\nyarn add sass\n```\n\nTo customize Bootstrap, create a file called `src/custom.scss` (or similar) and import the Bootstrap source stylesheet. Add any overrides _before_ the imported file(s). You can reference [Bootstrap's documentation](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.6/getting-started/theming/#variable-defaults) for the names of the available variables.\n\n```scss\n// Override default variables before the import\n$body-bg: #000;\n\n// Import Bootstrap and its default variables\n@import '~bootstrap/scss/bootstrap.scss';\n```\n\n> **Note:** You can prefix paths with `~`, as displayed above, to resolve modules from `node_modules`.\n\nFinally, import the newly created `.scss` file instead of the default Bootstrap `.css` in the beginning of your `src/index.js` file, for example:\n\n```javascript\nimport './custom.scss';\n```"

By default you will have `NODE_ENV` defined for you, and any other environment variables starting with `REACT_APP_`.\n\n> WARNING: Do not store any secrets (such as private API keys) in your React app!\n>\n> Environment variables are embedded into the build, meaning anyone can view them by inspecting your app's files.\n\n**The environment variables are embedded during the build time**. Since Create React App produces a static HTML/CSS/JS bundle, it can’t possibly read them at runtime. To read them at runtime, you would need to load HTML into memory on the server and replace placeholders in runtime, as [described here](title-and-meta-tags.md#injecting-data-from-the-server-into-the-page). Alternatively you can rebuild the app on the server anytime you change them.\n\n> Note: You must create custom environment variables beginning with `REACT_APP_`. Any other variables except `NODE_ENV` will be ignored to avoid accidentally [exposing a private key on the machine that could have the same name](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app/issues/865#issuecomment-252199527). Changing any environment variables will require you to restart the development server if it is running.\n\nThese environment variables will be defined for you on `process.env`. For example, having an environment variable named `REACT_APP_NOT_SECRET_CODE` will be exposed in your JS as `process.env.REACT_APP_NOT_SECRET_CODE`.\n\nThere is also a built-in environment variable called `NODE_ENV`. You can read it from `process.env.NODE_ENV`. When you run `npm start`, it is always equal to `'development'`, when you run `npm test` it is always equal to `'test'`, and when you run `npm run build` to make a production bundle, it is always equal to `'production'`. **You cannot override `NODE_ENV` manually.** This prevents developers from accidentally deploying a slow development build to production.\n\nThese environment variables can be useful for displaying information conditionally based on where the project is deployed or consuming sensitive data that lives outside of version control.\n\nFirst, you need to have environment variables defined. For example, let’s say you wanted to consume an environment variable inside a `<form>`:\n\n```jsx\nrender() {\n  return (\n    <div>\n      <small>You are running this application in <b>{process.env.NODE_ENV}</b> mode.</small>\n      <form>\n        <input type=\"hidden\" defaultValue={process.env.REACT_APP_NOT_SECRET_CODE} />\n      </form>\n    </div>\n  );\n}\n```\n\nDuring the build, `process.env.REACT_APP_NOT_SECRET_CODE` will be replaced with the current value of the `REACT_APP_NOT_SECRET_CODE` environment variable. Remember that the `NODE_ENV` variable will be set for you automatically.\n\nWhen you load the app in the browser and inspect the `<input>`, you will see its value set to `abcdef`, and the bold text will show the environment provided when using `npm start`:\n\n<!-- prettier-ignore-start -->\n\n```html\n<div>\n  <small>You are running this application in <b>development</b> mode.</small>\n  <form>\n    <input type=\"hidden\" value=\"abcdef\" />\n  </form>\n</div>\n```\n\n<!-- prettier-ignore-end -->\n\nThe above form is looking for a variable called `REACT_APP_NOT_SECRET_CODE` from the environment. In order to consume this value, we need to have it defined in the environment. This can be done using two ways: either in your shell or in a `.env` file. Both of these ways are described in the next few sections.\n\nHaving access to the `NODE_ENV` is also useful for performing actions conditionally:\n\n```js\nif (process.env.NODE_ENV !== 'production') {\n  analytics.disable();\n}\n```\n\nWhen you compile the app with `npm run build`, the minification step will strip out this condition, and the resulting bundle will be smaller.\n\n## Referencing Environment Variables in the HTML\n\n> Note: this feature is available with `react-scripts@0.9.0` and higher.\n\nYou can also access the environment variables starting with `REACT_APP_` in the `public/index.html`. For example:\n\n```html\n<title>%REACT_APP_WEBSITE_NAME%</title>\n```\n\nNote that the caveats from the above section apply:\n\n- Apart from a few built-in variables (`NODE_ENV` and `PUBLIC_URL`), variable names must start with `REACT_APP_` to work.\n- The environment variables are injected at build time. If you need to inject them at runtime, [follow this approach instead](title-and-meta-tags.md#generating-dynamic-meta-tags-on-the-server).\n\n## Adding Temporary Environment Variables In Your Shell\n\nDefining environment variables can vary between OSes. It’s also important to know that this manner is temporary for the life of the shell session.\n\n### Windows (cmd.exe)\n\n```cmd\nset \"REACT_APP_NOT_SECRET_CODE=abcdef\" && npm start\n```\n\n(Note: Quotes around the variable assignment are required to avoid a trailing whitespace.)\n\n### Windows (Powershell)\n\n```Powershell\n($env:REACT_APP_NOT_SECRET_CODE = \"abcdef\") -and (npm start)\n```\n\n### Linux, macOS (Bash)\n\n```sh\nREACT_APP_NOT_SECRET_CODE=abcdef npm start\n```\n\n## Adding Development Environment Variables In `.env`\n\n> Note: this feature is available with `react-scripts@0.5.0` and higher.\n\nTo define permanent environment variables, create a file called `.env` in the root of your project:\n\n```\nREACT_APP_NOT_SECRET_CODE=abcdef\n```\n\n> Note: You must create custom environment variables beginning with `REACT_APP_`. Any other variables except `NODE_ENV` will be ignored to avoid [accidentally exposing a private key on the machine that could have the same name](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app/issues/865#issuecomment-252199527). Changing any environment variables will require you to restart the development server if it is running.\n\n> Note: You need to restart the development server after changing `.env` files.\n\n`.env` files **should be** checked into source control (with the exclusion of `.env*.local`).\n\n### What other `.env` files can be used?\n\n> Note: this feature is **available with `react-scripts@1.0.0` and higher**.\n\n- `.env`: Default.\n- `.env.local`: Local overrides. **This file is loaded for all environments except test.**\n- `.env.development`, `.env.test`, `.env.production`: Environment-specific settings.\n- `.env.development.local`, `.env.test.local`, `.env.production.local`: Local overrides of environment-specific settings.\n\nFiles on the left have more priority than files on the right:\n\n- `npm start`: `.env.development.local`, `.env.local`, `.env.development`, `.env`\n- `npm run build`: `.env.production.local`, `.env.local`, `.env.production`, `.env`\n- `npm test`: `.env.test.local`, `.env.test`, `.env` (note `.env.local` is missing)\n\nThese variables will act as the defaults if the machine does not explicitly set them.\n\nPlease refer to the [dotenv documentation](https://github.com/motdotla/dotenv) for more details.\n\n> Note: If you are defining environment variables for development, your CI and/or hosting platform will most likely need\n> these defined as well. Consult their documentation how to do this. For example, see the documentation for [Travis CI](https://docs.travis-ci.com/user/environment-variables/) or [Heroku](https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/config-vars).\n\n### Expanding Environment Variables In `.env`\n\n> Note: this feature is available with `react-scripts@1.1.0` and higher.\n\nExpand variables already on your machine for use in your `.env` file (using [dotenv-expand](https://github.com/motdotla/dotenv-expand)).\n\nFor example, to get the environment variable `npm_package_version`:\n\n```\nREACT_APP_VERSION=$npm_package_version\n# also works:\n# REACT_APP_VERSION=${npm_package_version}\n```\n\nOr expand variables local to the current `.env` file:\n\n```\nDOMAIN=www.example.com\nREACT_APP_FOO=$DOMAIN/foo\nREACT_APP_BAR=$DOMAIN/bar\n```"

        "content": "---\nid: adding-images-fonts-and-files\ntitle: Adding Images, Fonts, and Files\n---\n\nWith webpack, using static assets like images and fonts works similarly to CSS.\n\nYou can **`import` a file right in a JavaScript module**. This tells webpack to include that file in the bundle. Unlike CSS imports, importing a file gives you a string value. This value is the final path you can reference in your code, e.g. as the `src` attribute of an image or the `href` of a link to a PDF.\n\nTo reduce the number of requests to the server, importing images that are less than 10,000 bytes returns a [data URI](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Basics_of_HTTP/Data_URIs) instead of a path. This applies to the following file extensions: bmp, gif, jpg, jpeg, and png. SVG files are excluded due to [#1153](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app/issues/1153). You can control the 10,000 byte threshold by setting the `IMAGE_INLINE_SIZE_LIMIT` environment variable as documented in our [advanced configuration](advanced-configuration.md).\n\nHere is an example:\n\n```js\nimport React from 'react';\nimport logo from './logo.png'; // Tell webpack this JS file uses this image\n\nconsole.log(logo); // /logo.84287d09.png\n\nfunction Header() {\n  // Import result is the URL of your image\n  return <img src={logo} alt=\"Logo\" />;\n}\n\nexport default Header;\n```\n\nThis ensures that when the project is built, webpack will correctly move the images into the build folder, and provide us with correct paths.\n\nThis works in CSS too:\n\n```css\n.Logo {\n  background-image: url(./logo.png);\n}\n```\n\nwebpack finds all relative module references in CSS (they start with `./`) and replaces them with the final paths from the compiled bundle. If you make a typo or accidentally delete an important file, you will see a compilation error, like when you import a non-existent JavaScript module. The final filenames in the compiled bundle are generated by webpack from content hashes. If the file content changes in the future, webpack will give it a different name in production so you don’t need to worry about long-term caching of assets.\n\nPlease be advised that this is also a custom feature of webpack.\n\n**It is not required for React** but many people enjoy it (and React Native uses a similar mechanism for images).\n\nAn alternative way of handling static assets is described in the next section.\n\n## Adding SVGs\n\n> Note: this feature is available with `react-scripts@2.0.0` and higher, and `react@16.3.0` and higher.\n\nOne way to add SVG files was described in the section above. You can also import SVGs directly as React components. You can use either of the two approaches. In your code it would look like this:\n\n```js\nimport { ReactComponent as Logo } from './logo.svg';\n\nfunction App() {\n  return (\n    <div>\n      {/* Logo is an actual React component */}\n      <Logo />\n    </div>\n  );\n}\n```\n\nThis is handy if you don't want to load SVG as a separate file. Don't forget the curly braces in the import! The `ReactComponent` import name is significant and tells Create React App that you want a React component that renders an SVG, rather than its filename.\n\n> **Tip:** The imported SVG React Component accepts a `title` prop along with other props that a `svg` element accepts. Use this prop to add an accessible title to your svg component."

Specify a [browser](https://github.com/sindresorhus/open#app) to override this behavior, or set it to `none` to disable it completely. If you need to customize the way the browser is launched, you can specify a node script instead. Any arguments passed to `npm start` will also be passed to this script, and the url where your app is served will be the last argument. Your script's file name must have the `.js` extension.                                                                                                                                      |\n| BROWSER_ARGS              |   ✅ Used   | 🚫 Ignored | When the `BROWSER` environment variable is specified, any arguments that you set to this environment variable will be passed to the browser instance.

Normally, Create React App ignores the hostname. You may use this variable to force assets to be referenced verbatim to the url you provide (hostname included). This may be particularly useful when using a CDN to host your application.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |\n| BUILD_PATH                | 🚫 Ignored  |  ✅ Used   | By default, Create React App will output compiled assets to a `/build` directory adjacent to your `/src`. You may use this variable to specify a new path for Create React App to output assets. BUILD_PATH should be specified as a path relative to the root of your project.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |\n| CI                        |   ✅ Used   |  ✅ Used   | When set to `true`, Create React App treats warnings as failures in the build. It also makes the test runner non-watching. Most CIs set this flag by default.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |\n| REACT_EDITOR              |   ✅ Used   | 🚫 Ignored | When an app crashes in development, you will see an error overlay with clickable stack trace. When you click on it, Create React App will try to determine the editor you are using based on currently running processes, and open the relevant source file. You can [send a pull request to detect your editor of choice](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app/issues/2636). Setting this environment variable overrides the automatic detection. If you do it, make sure your systems [PATH](<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PATH_(variable)>) environment variable points to your editor’s bin folder. You can also set it to `none` to disable it completely. |\n| CHOKIDAR_USEPOLLING       |   ✅ Used   | 🚫 Ignored | When set to `true`, the watcher runs in polling mode, as necessary inside a VM. Use this option if `npm start` isn't detecting changes.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |\n| GENERATE_SOURCEMAP        | 🚫 Ignored  |  ✅ Used   | When set to `false`, source maps are not generated for a production build. This solves out of memory (OOM) issues on some smaller machines.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |\n| INLINE_RUNTIME_CHUNK      | 🚫 Ignored  |  ✅ Used   | By default, Create React App will embed the runtime script into `index.html` during the production build. When set to `false`, the script will not be embedded and will be imported as usual.

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.\n\nThe page will reload if you make edits. You will also see any lint errors in the console.\n\n## `npm test`\n\nLaunches the test runner in the interactive watch mode. See the section about [running tests](running-tests.md) for more information.\n\n## `npm run build`\n\nBuilds the app for production to the `build` folder. It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.\n\nThe build is minified and the filenames include the hashes. If necessary, classnames and function names can be enabled for profiling purposes. See the [production build](production-build.md) section for more information.\n\nYour app is ready to be deployed! See the section about [deployment](deployment.md) for more information about deploying your application to popular hosting providers.\n\n## `npm run eject`\n\n**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**\n\nIf you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.\n\nInstead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc.) into your project as dependencies in `package.json`. Technically, the distinction between dependencies and development dependencies is pretty arbitrary for front-end apps that produce static bundles.\n\nIn addition, it used to cause problems with some hosting platforms that didn't install development dependencies (and thus weren't able to build the project on the server or test it right before deployment). You are free to rearrange your dependencies in `package.json` as you see fit.\n\nAll of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.\n\nYou don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it."

        "content": "---\nid: code-splitting\ntitle: Code Splitting\n---\n\nInstead of downloading the entire app before users can use it, code splitting allows you to split your code into small chunks which you can then load on demand.\n\nThis project setup supports code splitting via [dynamic `import()`](https://2ality.com/2017/01/import-operator.html#loading-code-on-demand). Its [proposal](https://github.com/tc39/proposal-dynamic-import) is in stage 4. The `import()` function-like form takes the module name as an argument and returns a [`Promise`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Promise) which always resolves to the namespace object of the module.\n\nHere is an example:\n\n## `moduleA.js`\n\n```js\nconst moduleA = 'Hello';\n\nexport { moduleA };\n```\n\n## `App.js`\n\n```js\nimport React, { Component } from 'react';\n\nclass App extends Component {\n  handleClick = () => {\n    import('./moduleA')\n      .then(({ moduleA }) => {\n        // Use moduleA\n      })\n      .catch(err => {\n        // Handle failure\n      });\n  };\n\n  render() {\n    return (\n      <div>\n        <button onClick={this.handleClick}>Load</button>\n      </div>\n    );\n  }\n}\n\nexport default App;\n```\n\nThis will make `moduleA.js` and all its unique dependencies as a separate chunk that only loads after the user clicks the 'Load' button. For more information on the chunks that are created, see the [production build](production-build.md) section.\n\nYou can also use it with `async` / `await` syntax if you prefer it.\n\n## With React Router\n\nIf you are using React Router check out [this tutorial](https://reactjs.org/docs/code-splitting.html#route-based-code-splitting)\n\nAlso check out the [Code Splitting](https://reactjs.org/docs/code-splitting.html) section in React documentation."

During this process, the file `gitignore` is renamed to `.gitignore`.\n\nYou can add whatever files you want in here, but you must have at least the files specified above.\n\n### The `template.json` file\n\nThis is the configuration file for your template. As this is a new feature, more options will be added over time. For now, only a `package` key is supported.\n\nThe `package` key lets you provide any keys/values that you want added to the new project's `package.json`, such as dependencies and any custom scripts that your template relies on.\n\nBelow is an example `template.json` file:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"package\": {\n    \"dependencies\": {\n      \"eslint-plugin-jsx-a11y\": \"^6.2.3\",\n      \"serve\": \"^11.2.0\"\n    },\n    \"scripts\": {\n      \"serve\": \"serve -s build\",\n      \"build-and-serve\": \"npm run build && npm run serve\"\n    },\n    \"eslintConfig\": {\n      \"extends\": [\"react-app\", \"plugin:jsx-a11y/recommended\"],\n      \"plugins\": [\"jsx-a11y\"]\n    }\n  }\n}\n```\n\nAny values you add for `\"dependencies\"` and `\"scripts\"` will be merged with the Create React App defaults. Values for any other keys will be used as-is, replacing any matching Create React App defaults.\n\nFor convenience, we always replace `npm run` with `yarn` in your custom `\"scripts\"`, as well as in your `README` when projects are initialized with yarn."

We cover debugging in Chrome and [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/).\n\n## Debugging Tests in Chrome\n\nAdd the following to the `scripts` section in your project's `package.json`\n\n```json\n\"scripts\": {\n    \"test:debug\": \"react-scripts --inspect-brk test --runInBand --no-cache\"\n  }\n```\n\nPlace `debugger;` statements in any test and run:\n\n```sh\n$ npm run test:debug\n```\n\nThis will start running your Jest tests, but pause before executing to allow a debugger to attach to the process.\n\nOpen the following in Chrome\n\n```\nabout:inspect\n```\n\nAfter opening that link, the Chrome Developer Tools will be displayed. Select `inspect` on your process and a breakpoint will be set at the first line of the react script (this is done to give you time to open the developer tools and to prevent Jest from executing before you have time to do so). Click the button that looks like a \"play\" button in the upper right hand side of the screen to continue execution. When Jest executes the test that contains the debugger statement, execution will pause and you can examine the current scope and call stack.\n\n> Note: the --runInBand cli option makes sure Jest runs test in the same process rather than spawning processes for individual tests. Normally Jest parallelizes test runs across processes but it is hard to debug many processes at the same time.\n\n## Debugging Tests in Visual Studio Code\n\nDebugging Jest tests is supported out of the box for [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com).\n\nUse the following [`launch.json`](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/editor/debugging#_launch-configurations) configuration file:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"version\": \"0.2.0\",\n  \"configurations\": [\n    {\n      \"name\": \"Debug CRA Tests\",\n      \"type\": \"node\",\n      \"request\": \"launch\",\n      \"runtimeExecutable\": \"${workspaceRoot}/node_modules/.bin/react-scripts\",\n      \"args\": [\"test\", \"--runInBand\", \"--no-cache\", \"--watchAll=false\"],\n      \"cwd\": \"${workspaceRoot}\",\n      \"protocol\": \"inspector\",\n      \"console\": \"integratedTerminal\",\n      \"internalConsoleOptions\": \"neverOpen\",\n      \"env\": { \"CI\": \"true\" },\n      \"disableOptimisticBPs\": true\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```"

For more information see the [production build](production-build.md) section.\n\n## Static Server\n\nFor environments using [Node](https://nodejs.org/), the easiest way to handle this would be to install [serve](https://github.com/vercel/serve) and let it handle the rest:\n\n```sh\nnpm install -g serve\nserve -s build\n```\n\nThe last command shown above will serve your static site on the port **3000**. Like many of [serve](https://github.com/vercel/serve)’s internal settings, the port can be adjusted using the `-l` or `--listen` flags:\n\n```sh\nserve -s build -l 4000\n```\n\nRun this command to get a full list of the options available:\n\n```sh\nserve -h\n```\n\n## Other Solutions\n\nYou don’t necessarily need a static server in order to run a Create React App project in production. It also works well when integrated into an existing server side app.\n\nHere’s a programmatic example using [Node](https://nodejs.org/) and [Express](https://expressjs.com/):\n\n```javascript\nconst express = require('express');\nconst path = require('path');\nconst app = express();\n\napp.use(express.static(path.join(__dirname, 'build')));\n\napp.get('/', function (req, res) {\n  res.sendFile(path.join(__dirname, 'build', 'index.html'));\n});\n\napp.listen(9000);\n```\n\nThe choice of your server software isn’t important either. Since Create React App is completely platform-agnostic, there’s no need to explicitly use Node.\n\nThe `build` folder with static assets is the only output produced by Create React App.\n\nHowever this is not quite enough if you use client-side routing. Read the next section if you want to support URLs like `/todos/42` in your single-page app.\n\n## Serving Apps with Client-Side Routing\n\nIf you use routers that use the HTML5 [`pushState` history API](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/History_API#Adding_and_modifying_history_entries) under the hood (for example, [React Router](https://github.com/ReactTraining/react-router) with `browserHistory`), many static file servers will fail. For example, if you used React Router with a route for `/todos/42`, the development server will respond to `localhost:3000/todos/42` properly, but an Express serving a production build as above will not.\n\nThis is because when there is a fresh page load for a `/todos/42`, the server looks for the file `build/todos/42` and does not find it. The server needs to be configured to respond to a request to `/todos/42` by serving `index.html`. For example, we can amend our Express example above to serve `index.html` for any unknown paths:\n\n```diff\n app.use(express.static(path.join(__dirname, 'build')));\n\n-app.get('/', function (req, res) {\n+app.get('/*', function (req, res) {\n   res.sendFile(path.join(__dirname, 'build', 'index.html'));\n });\n```\n\nIf you’re using [Apache HTTP Server](https://httpd.apache.org/), you need to create a `.htaccess` file in the `public` folder that looks like this:\n\n```\n    Options -MultiViews\n    RewriteEngine On\n    RewriteCond %{REQUEST_FILENAME} !-f\n    RewriteRule ^ index.html [QSA,L]\n```\n\nIt will get copied to the `build` folder when you run `npm run build`.\n\nIf you’re using [Apache Tomcat](https://tomcat.apache.org/), you need to follow [this Stack Overflow answer](https://stackoverflow.com/a/41249464/4878474).\n\nNow requests to `/todos/42` will be handled correctly both in development and in production.\n\nOn a production build, and when you've [opted-in](making-a-progressive-web-app.md#why-opt-in),\na [service worker](https://developers.google.com/web/fundamentals/primers/service-workers/) will automatically handle all navigation requests, like for\n`/todos/42`, by serving the cached copy of your `index.html`. This\nservice worker navigation routing can be configured or disabled by\n[`eject`ing](available-scripts.md#npm-run-eject) and then modifying the\n[`navigateFallback`](https://github.com/GoogleChrome/sw-precache#navigatefallback-string)\nand [`navigateFallbackWhitelist`](https://github.com/GoogleChrome/sw-precache#navigatefallbackwhitelist-arrayregexp)\noptions of the `SWPrecachePlugin` configuration.\n\nWhen users install your app to the homescreen of their device the default configuration will make a shortcut to `/index.html`. This may not work for client-side routers which expect the app to be served from `/`. Edit the web app manifest at `public/manifest.json` and change `start_url` to match the required URL scheme, for example:\n\n```js\n  \"start_url\": \".\",\n```\n\n## Building for Relative Paths\n\nBy default, Create React App produces a build assuming your app is hosted at the server root.\n\nTo override this, specify the `homepage` in your `package.json`, for example:\n\n```js\n  \"homepage\": \"http://mywebsite.com/relativepath\",\n```\n\nThis will let Create React App correctly infer the root path to use in the generated HTML file.\n\n**Note**: If you are using `react-router@^4`, you can root `<Link>`s using the `basename` prop on any `<Router>`.\n\nMore information [here](https://reacttraining.com/react-router/web/api/BrowserRouter/basename-string).\n\nFor example:\n\n```js\n<BrowserRouter basename=\"/calendar\"/>\n<Link to=\"/today\"/> // renders <a href=\"/calendar/today\">\n```\n\n### Serving the Same Build from Different Paths\n\n> Note: this feature is available with `react-scripts@0.9.0` and higher.\n\nIf you are not using the HTML5 `pushState` history API or not using client-side routing at all, it is unnecessary to specify the URL from which your app will be served. Instead, you can put this in your `package.json`:\n\n```js\n  \"homepage\": \".\",\n```\n\nThis will make sure that all the asset paths are relative to `index.html`. You will then be able to move your app from `http://mywebsite.com` to `http://mywebsite.com/relativepath` or even `http://mywebsite.com/relative/path` without having to rebuild it.\n\n## Customizing Environment Variables for Arbitrary Build Environments\n\nYou can create an arbitrary build environment by creating a custom `.env` file and loading it using [env-cmd](https://www.npmjs.com/package/env-cmd).\n\nFor example, to create a build environment for a staging environment:\n\n1. Create a file called `.env.staging`\n1. Set environment variables as you would any other `.env` file (e.g. `REACT_APP_API_URL=http://api-staging.example.com`)\n1. Install [env-cmd](https://www.npmjs.com/package/env-cmd)\n   ```sh\n   $ npm install env-cmd --save\n   $ # or\n   $ yarn add env-cmd\n   ```\n1. Add a new script to your `package.json`, building with your new environment:\n   ```json\n   {\n     \"scripts\": {\n       \"build:staging\": \"env-cmd -f .env.staging npm run build\"\n     }\n   }\n   ```\n\nNow you can run `npm run build:staging` to build with the staging environment config.\nYou can specify other environments in the same way.\n\nVariables in `.env.production` will be used as fallback because `NODE_ENV` will always be set to `production` for a build.\n\n## [AWS Amplify](https://console.amplify.aws)\n\nThe AWS Amplify Console provides continuous deployment and hosting for modern web apps (single page apps and static site generators) with serverless backends. The Amplify Console offers globally available CDNs, custom domain setup, feature branch deployments, and password protection.\n\n1. Login to the Amplify Console [here](https://console.aws.amazon.com/amplify/home).\n1. Connect your Create React App repo and pick a branch. If you're looking for a Create React App+Amplify starter, try the [create-react-app-auth-amplify starter](https://github.com/swaminator/create-react-app-auth-amplify) that demonstrates setting up auth in 10 minutes with Create React App.\n1. The Amplify Console automatically detects the build settings. Choose Next.\n1. Choose _Save and deploy_.\n\nIf the build succeeds, the app is deployed and hosted on a global CDN with an amplifyapp.com domain. You can now continuously deploy changes to your frontend or backend. Continuous deployment allows developers to deploy updates to their frontend and backend on every code commit to their Git repository.\n\n## [Azure](https://azure.microsoft.com/)\n\nAzure Static Web Apps creates an automated build and deploy pipeline for your React app powered by GitHub Actions. Applications are geo-distributed by default with multiple points of presence. PR's are built automatically for staging environment previews.\n\n1. Create a new Static Web App [here](https://ms.portal.azure.com/#create/Microsoft.StaticApp).\n1. Add in the details and connect to your GitHub repo.\n1. Make sure the build folder is set correctly on the \"build\" tab and create the resource.\n\nAzure Static Web Apps will automatically configure a GitHub Action in your repo and begin the deployment.\n\nSee the [Azure Static Web Apps documentation](https://aka.ms/swadocs) for more information on routing, APIs, authentication and authorization, custom domains and more.\n\n## [Firebase](https://firebase.google.com/)\n\nInstall the Firebase CLI if you haven’t already by running `npm install -g firebase-tools`. Sign up for a [Firebase account](https://console.firebase.google.com/) and create a new project. Run `firebase login` and login with your previous created Firebase account.\n\nThen run the `firebase init` command from your project’s root. You need to choose the **Hosting: Configure and deploy Firebase Hosting sites** and choose the Firebase project you created in the previous step. You will need to agree with `database.rules.json` being created, choose `build` as the public directory, and also agree to **Configure as a single-page app** by replying with `y`.\n\n```sh\n    === Project Setup\n\n    First, let's associate this project directory with a Firebase project.\n    You can create multiple project aliases by running firebase use --add,\n    but for now we'll set up a default project.\n\n    ? What Firebase project do you want to associate as default? Example app (example-app-fd690)\n\n    === Database Setup\n\n    Firebase Realtime Database Rules allow you to define how your data should be\n    structured and when your data can be read from and written to.\n\n    ? What file should be used for Database Rules? database.rules.json\n    ✔  Database Rules for example-app-fd690 have been downloaded to database.rules.json.\n    Future modifications to database.rules.json will update Database Rules when you run\n    firebase deploy.\n\n    === Hosting Setup\n\n    Your public directory is the folder (relative to your project directory) that\n    will contain Hosting assets to uploaded with firebase deploy. If you\n    have a build process for your assets, use your build's output directory.\n\n    ? What do you want to use as your public directory? build\n    ? Configure as a single-page app (rewrite all urls to /index.html)? Yes\n    ✔  Wrote build/index.html\n\n    i  Writing configuration info to firebase.json...\n    i  Writing project information to .firebaserc...\n\n    ✔  Firebase initialization complete!\n```\n\nIMPORTANT: you need to set proper HTTP caching headers for `service-worker.js` file in `firebase.json` file or you will not be able to see changes after first deployment ([issue #2440](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app/issues/2440)). It should be added inside `\"hosting\"` key like next:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"hosting\": {\n    ...\n    \"headers\": [\n      {\"source\": \"/service-worker.js\", \"headers\": [{\"key\": \"Cache-Control\", \"value\": \"no-cache\"}]}\n    ]\n    ...\n```\n\nNow, after you create a production build with `npm run build`, you can deploy it by running `firebase deploy`.\n\n```sh\n    === Deploying to 'example-app-fd690'...\n\n    i  deploying database, hosting\n    ✔  database: rules ready to deploy.\n    i  hosting: preparing build directory for upload...\n    Uploading: [==============================          ] 75%✔  hosting: build folder uploaded successfully\n    ✔  hosting: 8 files uploaded successfully\n    i  starting release process (may take several minutes)...\n\n    ✔  Deploy complete!\n\n    Project Console: https://console.firebase.google.com/project/example-app-fd690/overview\n    Hosting URL: https://example-app-fd690.firebaseapp.com\n```\n\nFor more information see [Firebase Hosting](https://firebase.google.com/docs/hosting).\n\n## [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/)\n\n> Note: this feature is available with `react-scripts@0.2.0` and higher.\n\n### Step 1: Add `homepage` to `package.json`\n\n**The step below is important!**<br/>\n\n**If you skip it, your app will not deploy correctly.**\n\nOpen your `package.json` and add a `homepage` field for your project:\n\n```json\n  \"homepage\": \"https://myusername.github.io/my-app\",\n```\n\nor for a GitHub user page:\n\n```json\n  \"homepage\": \"https://myusername.github.io\",\n```\n\nor for a custom domain page:\n\n```json\n  \"homepage\": \"https://mywebsite.com\",\n```\n\nCreate React App uses the `homepage` field to determine the root URL in the built HTML file.\n\n### Step 2: Install `gh-pages` and add `deploy` to `scripts` in `package.json`\n\nNow, whenever you run `npm run build`, you will see a cheat sheet with instructions on how to deploy to GitHub Pages.\n\nTo publish it at [https://myusername.github.io/my-app](https://myusername.github.io/my-app), run:\n\n```sh\nnpm install --save gh-pages\n```\n\nAlternatively you may use `yarn`:\n\n```sh\nyarn add gh-pages\n```\n\nAdd the following scripts in your `package.json`:\n\n```diff\n  \"scripts\": {\n+   \"predeploy\": \"npm run build\",\n+   \"deploy\": \"gh-pages -d build\",\n    \"start\": \"react-scripts start\",\n    \"build\": \"react-scripts build\",\n```\n\nThe `predeploy` script will run automatically before `deploy` is run.\n\nIf you are deploying to a GitHub user page instead of a project page you'll need to make one\nadditional modification:\n\n1. Tweak your `package.json` scripts to push deployments to **main**:\n\n```diff\n  \"scripts\": {\n    \"predeploy\": \"npm run build\",\n-   \"deploy\": \"gh-pages -d build\",\n+   \"deploy\": \"gh-pages -b main -d build\",\n```\n\n### Step 3: Deploy the site by running `npm run deploy`\n\nThen run:\n\n```sh\nnpm run deploy\n```\n\n### Step 4: For a project page, ensure your project’s settings use `gh-pages`\n\nFinally, make sure **GitHub Pages** option in your GitHub project settings is set to use the `gh-pages` branch:\n\n<img src=\"https://i.imgur.com/HUjEr9l.png\" width=\"500\" alt=\"gh-pages branch setting\" />\n\n### Step 5: Optionally, configure the domain\n\nYou can configure a custom domain with GitHub Pages by adding a `CNAME` file to the `public/` folder.\n\nYour CNAME file should look like this:\n\n```\nmywebsite.com\n```\n\n### Notes on client-side routing\n\nGitHub Pages doesn’t support routers that use the HTML5 `pushState` history API under the hood (for example, React Router using `browserHistory`). This is because when there is a fresh page load for a url like `http://user.github.io/todomvc/todos/42`, where `/todos/42` is a frontend route, the GitHub Pages server returns 404 because it knows nothing of `/todos/42`. If you want to add a router to a project hosted on GitHub Pages, here are a couple of solutions:\n\n- You could switch from using HTML5 history API to routing with hashes. If you use React Router, you can switch to `hashHistory` for this effect, but the URL will be longer and more verbose (for example, `http://user.github.io/todomvc/#/todos/42?_k=yknaj`). [Read more](https://reacttraining.com/react-router/web/api/Router) about different history implementations in React Router.\n- Alternatively, you can use a trick to teach GitHub Pages to handle 404s by redirecting to your `index.html` page with a custom redirect parameter. You would need to add a `404.html` file with the redirection code to the `build` folder before deploying your project, and you’ll need to add code handling the redirect parameter to `index.html`. You can find a detailed explanation of this technique [in this guide](https://github.com/rafrex/spa-github-pages).\n\n### Troubleshooting\n\n#### \"/dev/tty: No such a device or address\"\n\nIf, when deploying, you get `/dev/tty: No such a device or address` or a similar error, try the following:\n\n1. Create a new [Personal Access Token](https://github.com/settings/tokens)\n2. `git remote set-url origin https://<user>:<token>@github.com/<user>/<repo>` .\n3. Try `npm run deploy` again\n\n#### \"Cannot read property 'email' of null\"\n\nIf, when deploying, you get `Cannot read property 'email' of null`, try the following:\n\n1. `git config --global user.name '<your_name>'`\n2. `git config --global user.email '<your_email>'`\n3. Try `npm run deploy` again\n\n## [Heroku](https://www.heroku.com/)\n\nUse the [Heroku Buildpack for Create React App](https://github.com/heroku/heroku-buildpack-nodejs).\n\nYou can find instructions in [Deploying React with Zero Configuration](https://blog.heroku.com/deploying-react-with-zero-configuration).\n\n### Resolving Heroku Deployment Errors\n\nSometimes `npm run build` works locally but fails during deploy via Heroku. Following are the most common cases.\n\n#### \"Module not found: Error: Cannot resolve 'file' or 'directory'\"\n\nIf you get something like this:\n\n```\nremote: Failed to create a production build. Reason:\nremote: Module not found: Error: Cannot resolve 'file' or 'directory'\nMyDirectory in /tmp/build_1234/src\n```\n\nIt means you need to ensure that the lettercase of the file or directory you `import` matches the one you see on your filesystem or on GitHub.\n\nThis is important because Linux (the operating system used by Heroku) is case sensitive. So `MyDirectory` and `mydirectory` are two distinct directories and thus, even though the project builds locally, the difference in case breaks the `import` statements on Heroku remotes.\n\n#### \"Could not find a required file.\"\n\nIf you exclude or ignore necessary files from the package you will see a error similar this one:\n\n```\nremote: Could not find a required file.\nremote:   Name: `index.html`\nremote:   Searched in: /tmp/build_a2875fc163b209225122d68916f1d4df/public\nremote:\nremote: npm ERR! Linux 3.13.0-105-generic\nremote: npm ERR! argv \"/tmp/build_a2875fc163b209225122d68916f1d4df/.heroku/node/bin/node\" \"/tmp/build_a2875fc163b209225122d68916f1d4df/.heroku/node/bin/npm\" \"run\" \"build\"\n```\n\nIn this case, ensure that the file is there with the proper lettercase and that’s not ignored on your local `.gitignore` or `~/.gitignore_global`.\n\n## [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/)\n\n**To do a manual deploy to Netlify’s CDN:**\n\n```sh\nnpm install netlify-cli -g\nnetlify deploy\n```\n\nChoose `build` as the path to deploy.\n\n**To setup continuous delivery:**\n\nWith this setup Netlify will build and deploy when you push to git or open a pull request:\n\n1. [Start a new netlify project](https://app.netlify.com/signup)\n2. Pick your Git hosting service and select your repository\n3. Click `Build your site`\n\n**Support for client-side routing:**\n\nTo support `pushState`, make sure to create a `public/_redirects` file with the following rewrite rules:\n\n```\n/*  /index.html  200\n```\n\nWhen you build the project, Create React App will place the `public` folder contents into the build output.\n\n## [Vercel](https://vercel.com)\n\n[Vercel](https://vercel.com/home) is a cloud platform that enables developers to host Jamstack websites and web services that deploy instantly, scale automatically, and requires no supervision, all with zero configuration. They provide a global edge network, SSL encryption, asset compression, cache invalidation, and more.\n\n### Step 1: Deploying your React project to Vercel\n\nTo deploy your React project with a [Vercel for Git Integration](https://vercel.com/docs/git-integrations), make sure it has been pushed to a Git repository.\n\nImport the project into Vercel using the [Import Flow](https://vercel.com/import/git). During the import, you will find all relevant [options](https://vercel.com/docs/build-step#build-&-development-settings) preconfigured for you with the ability to change as needed.\n\nAfter your project has been imported, all subsequent pushes to branches will generate [Preview Deployments](https://vercel.com/docs/platform/deployments#preview), and all changes made to the [Production Branch](https://vercel.com/docs/git-integrations#production-branch) (commonly \"master\" or \"main\") will result in a [Production Deployment](https://vercel.com/docs/platform/deployments#production).\n\nOnce deployed, you will get a URL to see your app live, such as the following: https://create-react-app-example.vercel.app/.\n\n### Step 2 (optional): Using a Custom Domain\n\nIf you want to use a Custom Domain with your Vercel deployment, you can **Add** or **Transfer in** your domain via your Vercel [account Domain settings.](https://vercel.com/dashboard/domains)\n\nTo add your domain to your project, navigate to your [Project](https://vercel.com/docs/platform/projects) from the Vercel Dashboard. Once you have selected your project, click on the \"Settings\" tab, then select the **Domains** menu item. From your projects **Domain** page, enter the domain you wish to add to your project.\n\nOnce the domain has been added, you will be presented with different methods for configuring it.\n\n### Deploying a fresh React project\n\nYou can deploy a fresh React project, with a Git repository set up for you, with the following Deploy Button:\n\n[![Deploy with Vercel](https://vercel.com/button)](https://vercel.com/import/git?s=https%3A%2F%2Fgithub.com%2Fvercel%2Fvercel%2Ftree%2Fmaster%2Fexamples%2Fcreate-react-app)\n\n### Vercel References:\n\n- [Example Source](https://github.com/vercel/vercel/tree/master/examples/create-react-app)\n- [Official Vercel Guide](https://vercel.com/guides/deploying-react-with-vercel-cra)\n- [Vercel Deployment Docs](https://vercel.com/docs)\n- [Vercel Custom Domain Docs](https://vercel.com/docs/custom-domains)\n\n## [Render](https://render.com)\n\nRender offers free [static site](https://render.com/docs/static-sites) hosting with fully managed SSL, a global CDN and continuous auto deploys from GitHub.\n\nDeploy your app in only a few minutes by following the [Create React App deployment guide](https://render.com/docs/deploy-create-react-app).\n\nUse invite code `cra` to sign up or use [this link](https://render.com/i/cra).\n\n## [S3](https://aws.amazon.com/s3) and [CloudFront](https://aws.amazon.com/cloudfront/)\n\nSee this [blog post](https://medium.com/@omgwtfmarc/deploying-create-react-app-to-s3-or-cloudfront-48dae4ce0af) on how to deploy your React app to Amazon Web Services S3 and CloudFront. If you are looking to add a custom domain, HTTPS and continuous deployment see this [blog post](https://medium.com/dailyjs/a-guide-to-deploying-your-react-app-with-aws-s3-including-https-a-custom-domain-a-cdn-and-58245251f081).\n\n## [Surge](https://surge.sh/)\n\nInstall the Surge CLI if you haven’t already by running `npm install -g surge`. Run the `surge` command and log in you or create a new account.\n\nWhen asked about the project path, make sure to specify the `build` folder, for example:\n\n```sh\n       project path: /path/to/project/build\n```\n\nNote that in order to support routers that use HTML5 `pushState` API, you may want to rename the `index.html` in your build folder to `200.html` before deploying to Surge. This [ensures that every URL falls back to that file](https://surge.sh/help/adding-a-200-page-for-client-side-routing).\n\n## Publishing Components To npm\n\nCreate React App doesn't provide any built-in functionality to publish a component to npm. If you're ready to extract a component from your project so other people can use it, we recommend moving it to a separate directory outside of your project and then using a tool like [nwb](https://github.com/insin/nwb#react-components-and-libraries) to prepare it for publishing."

        "content": "---\nid: developing-components-in-isolation\ntitle: Developing Components in Isolation\n---\n\nUsually, in an app, you have a lot of UI components, and each of them has many different states.\nFor an example, a basic button component could have the following states:\n\n- In a regular state, with a text label.\n- In the disabled mode.\n- In a loading state.\n\nUsually, it’s hard to see these states without running a sample app or some examples.\n\nCreate React App doesn’t include any tools for this by default, but you can add [Storybook for React](https://storybook.js.org) ([source](https://github.com/storybooks/storybook)) or [React Styleguidist](https://react-styleguidist.js.org/) ([source](https://github.com/styleguidist/react-styleguidist)) to your project. **These are third-party tools that let you develop components and see all their states in isolation from your app**.\n\n![Storybook for React Demo](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/storybookjs/storybook/next/docs/get-started/storybook-third-party-docs.gif)\n\nYou can also deploy your Storybook or style guide as a static app. This way, everyone in your team can view and review different states of UI components without starting a backend server or creating an account in your app.\n\n## Getting Started with Storybook\n\nStorybook is a development environment for React UI components. It allows you to browse a component library, view the different states of each component, and interactively develop and test components.\n\nRun the following command inside your app’s directory:\n\n```sh\nnpx sb init\n```\n\nAfter that, follow the instructions on the screen.\n\nLearn more about React Storybook:\n\n- [Learn Storybook (tutorial)](https://storybook.js.org/tutorials/)\n- [Documentation](https://storybook.js.org/docs/react/get-started/introduction)\n- [GitHub Repo](https://github.com/storybooks/storybook)\n- [Snapshot Testing UI](https://github.com/storybooks/storybook/tree/master/addons/storyshots) with Storybook + addon/storyshot\n\n## Getting Started with Styleguidist\n\nStyleguidist combines a style guide, where all your components are presented on a single page with their props documentation and usage examples, with an environment for developing components in isolation, similar to Storybook. In Styleguidist you write examples in Markdown, where each code snippet is rendered as a live editable playground.\n\nFirst, install Styleguidist:\n\n```sh\nnpm install --save react-styleguidist\n```\n\nAlternatively you may use `yarn`:\n\n```sh\nyarn add react-styleguidist\n```\n\nThen, add these scripts to your `package.json`:\n\n```diff\n   \"scripts\": {\n+    \"styleguide\": \"styleguidist server\",\n+    \"styleguide:build\": \"styleguidist build\",\n     \"start\": \"react-scripts start\",\n```\n\nThen, run the following command inside your app’s directory:\n\n```sh\nnpm run styleguide\n```\n\nAfter that, follow the instructions on the screen.\n\nLearn more about React Styleguidist:\n\n- [GitHub Repo](https://github.com/styleguidist/react-styleguidist)\n- [Documentation](https://react-styleguidist.js.org/docs/getting-started.html)"

It takes in a URL as an input and returns a `Promise` that resolves to a `Response` object. You can find more information about `fetch` [here](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Fetch_API/Using_Fetch).\n\nA Promise represents the eventual result of an asynchronous operation, you can find more information about Promises [here](https://www.promisejs.org/) and [here](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Promise). Both axios and `fetch()` use Promises under the hood. You can also use the [`async / await`](https://davidwalsh.name/async-await) syntax to reduce the callback nesting.\n\nMake sure the [`fetch()` API](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Fetch_API) and [Promises](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Promise) are available in your target audience's browsers.\nFor example, support in Internet Explorer requires a [polyfill](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app/blob/main/packages/react-app-polyfill/README.md).\n\nYou can learn more about making AJAX requests from React components in [the FAQ entry on the React website](https://reactjs.org/docs/faq-ajax.html)."

They are preconfigured and hidden so that you can focus on the code.\n\nCreate a project, and you’re good to go.\n\n## Creating an App\n\n**You’ll need to have Node >= 14 on your local development machine** (but it’s not required on the server). You can use [nvm](https://github.com/creationix/nvm#installation) (macOS/Linux) or [nvm-windows](https://github.com/coreybutler/nvm-windows#node-version-manager-nvm-for-windows) to switch Node versions between different projects.\n\nTo create a new app, you may choose one of the following methods:\n\n### npx\n\n```sh\nnpx create-react-app@latest my-app\n```\n\n_([npx](https://medium.com/@maybekatz/introducing-npx-an-npm-package-runner-55f7d4bd282b) comes with npm 5.2+ and higher, see [instructions for older npm versions](https://gist.github.com/gaearon/4064d3c23a77c74a3614c498a8bb1c5f))_\n\n### npm\n\n```sh\nnpm init react-app my-app\n```\n\n_`npm init <initializer>` is available in npm 6+_\n\n### Yarn\n\n```sh\nyarn create react-app my-app\n```\n\n_`yarn create` is available in Yarn 0.25+_\n\n### Selecting a template\n\nYou can now optionally start a new app from a template by appending `--template [template-name]` to the creation command.\n\nIf you don't select a template, we'll create your project with our base template.\n\nTemplates are always named in the format `cra-template-[template-name]`, however you only need to provide the `[template-name]` to the creation command.\n\n```sh\nnpx create-react-app my-app --template [template-name]\n```\n\n> You can find a list of available templates by searching for [\"cra-template-\\*\"](https://www.npmjs.com/search?q=cra-template-*) on npm.\n\nOur [Custom Templates](custom-templates.md) documentation describes how you can build your own template.\n\n#### Creating a TypeScript app\n\nYou can start a new TypeScript app using templates. To use our provided TypeScript template, append `--template typescript` to the creation command.\n\n```sh\nnpx create-react-app my-app --template typescript\n```\n\nIf you already have a project and would like to add TypeScript, see our [Adding TypeScript](adding-typescript.md) documentation.\n\n### Selecting a package manager\n\nWhen you create a new app, the CLI will use [npm](https://docs.npmjs.com) or [Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/) to install dependencies, depending on which tool you use to run `create-react-app`. For example:\n\n```sh\n# Run this to use npm\nnpx create-react-app my-app\n# Or run this to use yarn\nyarn create react-app my-app\n```\n\n## Output\n\nRunning any of these commands will create a directory called `my-app` inside the current folder. Inside that directory, it will generate the initial project structure and install the transitive dependencies:\n\n```\nmy-app\n├── README.md\n├── node_modules\n├── package.json\n├── .gitignore\n├── public\n│   ├── favicon.ico\n│   ├── index.html\n│   ├── logo192.png\n│   ├── logo512.png\n│   ├── manifest.json\n│   └── robots.txt\n└── src\n    ├── App.css\n    ├── App.js\n    ├── App.test.js\n    ├── index.css\n    ├── index.js\n    ├── logo.svg\n    ├── serviceWorker.js\n    └── setupTests.js\n```\n\nNo configuration or complicated folder structures, only the files you need to build your app. Once the installation is done, you can open your project folder:\n\n```sh\ncd my-app\n```\n\n## Scripts\n\nInside the newly created project, you can run some built-in commands:\n\n### `npm start` or `yarn start`\n\nRuns the app in development mode. Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.\n\nThe page will automatically reload if you make changes to the code. You will see the build errors and lint warnings in the console.\n\n<p align='center'>\n<img src='https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/marionebl/create-react-app@9f6282671c54f0874afd37a72f6689727b562498/screencast-error.svg' width='600' alt='Build errors' />\n</p>\n\n### `npm test` or `yarn test`\n\nRuns the test watcher in an interactive mode. By default, runs tests related to files changed since the last commit.\n\n[Read more about testing](running-tests.md).\n\n### `npm run build` or `yarn build`\n\nBuilds the app for production to the `build` folder. It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.\n\nThe build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\n\nYour app is ready to be deployed."

It is a common source of mistakes.\n\nWe suggest that you stick to using default imports and exports when a module only exports a single thing (for example, a component). That’s what you get when you use `export default Button` and `import Button from './Button'`.\n\nNamed exports are useful for utility modules that export several functions. A module may have at most one default export and as many named exports as you like.\n\nLearn more about ES6 modules:\n\n- [When to use the curly braces?](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/36795819/react-native-es-6-when-should-i-use-curly-braces-for-import/36796281#36796281)\n- [Exploring ES6: Modules](https://exploringjs.com/es6/ch_modules.html)\n- [Understanding ES6: Modules](https://leanpub.com/understandinges6/read#leanpub-auto-encapsulating-code-with-modules)\n\n## Absolute Imports\n\nYou can configure your application to support importing modules using absolute paths. This can be done by configuring a `jsconfig.json` or `tsconfig.json` file in the root of your project. If you're using TypeScript in your project, you will already have a `tsconfig.json` file.\n\nBelow is an example `jsconfig.json` file for a JavaScript project. You can create the file if it doesn't already exist:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"compilerOptions\": {\n    \"baseUrl\": \"src\"\n  },\n  \"include\": [\"src\"]\n}\n```\n\nIf you're using TypeScript, you can configure the `baseUrl` setting inside the `compilerOptions` of your project's `tsconfig.json` file.\n\nNow that you've configured your project to support absolute imports, if you want to import a module located at `src/components/Button.js`, you can import the module like so:\n\n```js\nimport Button from 'components/Button';\n```\n\nFor more information on these configuration files, see the [jsconfig.json reference](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/languages/jsconfig) and [tsconfig.json reference](https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/handbook/tsconfig-json.html) documentation."

The `InjectManifest` plugin won't be run in that\ncase.\n\nIn addition to creating your local `src/service-worker.js` file, it needs to be\nregistered before it will be used. In order to opt-in to the offline-first\nbehavior, developers should look for the following in their\n[`src/index.js`](https://github.com/cra-template/pwa/blob/master/packages/cra-template-pwa/template/src/index.js)\nfile:\n\n```js\n// If you want your app to work offline and load faster, you can change\n// unregister() to register() below. Note this comes with some pitfalls.\n// Learn more about service workers: https://cra.link/PWA\nserviceWorkerRegistration.unregister();\n```\n\nAs the comment states, switching `serviceWorker.unregister()` to\n`serviceWorker.register()` will opt you in to using the service worker.\n\n## Why Opt-in?\n\nOffline-first Progressive Web Apps are faster and more reliable than traditional\nweb pages, and provide an engaging mobile experience:\n\n- All static site assets that are a part of your `webpack` build are cached so\n  that your page loads fast on subsequent visits, regardless of network\n  connectivity (such as 2G or 3G). Updates are downloaded in the background.\n- Your app will work regardless of network state, even if offline. This means\n  your users will be able to use your app at 10,000 feet and on the subway.\n- On mobile devices, your app can be added directly to the user's home screen,\n  app icon and all. This eliminates the need for the app store.\n\nHowever, they [can make debugging deployments more\nchallenging](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app/issues/2398).\n\nThe\n[`workbox-webpack-plugin`](https://developer.chrome.com/docs/workbox/modules/workbox-webpack-plugin/)\nis integrated into production configuration, and it will take care of compiling\na service worker file that will automatically precache all of your\n`webpack`-generated assets and keep them up to date as you deploy updates. The\nservice worker will use a [cache-first\nstrategy](https://developers.google.com/web/fundamentals/instant-and-offline/offline-cookbook/#cache-falling-back-to-network)\nfor handling all requests for `webpack`-generated assets, including [navigation\nrequests](https://developers.google.com/web/fundamentals/primers/service-workers/high-performance-loading#first_what_are_navigation_requests)\nfor your HTML, ensuring that your web app is consistently fast, even on a slow\nor unreliable network.\n\nNote: Resources that are not generated by `webpack`, such as static files that are\ncopied over from your local\n[`public/` directory](https://github.com/cra-template/pwa/tree/master/packages/cra-template-pwa/template/public/)\nor third-party resources, will not be precached. You can optionally set up Workbox\n[routes](https://developers.google.com/web/tools/workbox/guides/route-requests)\nto apply the runtime caching strategy of your choice to those resources.\n\n## Customization\n\nStarting with Create React App 4, you have full control over customizing the\nlogic in this service worker, by creating your own `src/service-worker.js` file,\nor customizing the one added by the `cra-template-pwa` (or\n`cra-template-pwa-typescript`) template. You can use [additional\nmodules](https://developers.google.com/web/tools/workbox/modules) from the\nWorkbox project, add in a push notification library, or remove some of the\ndefault caching logic. The one requirement is that you keep `self.__WB_MANIFEST`\nsomewhere in your file, as the Workbox compilation plugin checks for this value\nwhen generating a manifest of URLs to precache. If you would prefer not to use\nprecaching, you can assign `self.__WB_MANIFEST` to a variable that will be\nignored, like:\n\n```js\n// eslint-disable-next-line no-restricted-globals\nconst ignored = self.__WB_MANIFEST;\n\n// Your custom service worker code goes here.\n```\n\n## Offline-First Considerations\n\nIf you do decide to opt-in to service worker registration, please take the\nfollowing into account:\n\n1. After the initial caching is done, the [service worker lifecycle](https://developers.google.com/web/fundamentals/primers/service-workers/lifecycle)\n   controls when updated content ends up being shown to users. In order to guard against\n   [race conditions with lazy-loaded content](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app/issues/3613#issuecomment-353467430),\n   the default behavior is to conservatively keep the updated service worker in the \"[waiting](https://developers.google.com/web/fundamentals/primers/service-workers/lifecycle#waiting)\"\n   state. This means that users will end up seeing older content until they close (reloading is not\n   enough) their existing, open tabs. See [this blog post](https://jeffy.info/2018/10/10/sw-in-c-r-a.html)\n   for more details about this behavior.\n\n1. Users aren't always familiar with offline-first web apps. It can be useful to\n   [let the user know](https://developers.google.com/web/fundamentals/instant-and-offline/offline-ux#inform_the_user_when_the_app_is_ready_for_offline_consumption)\n   when the service worker has finished populating your caches (showing a \"This web\n   app works offline!\" message) and also let them know when the service worker has\n   fetched the latest updates that will be available the next time they load the\n   page (showing a \"New content is available once existing tabs are closed.\" message). Showing\n   these messages is currently left as an exercise to the developer, but as a\n   starting point, you can make use of the logic included in [`src/serviceWorkerRegistration.js`](https://github.com/cra-template/pwa/blob/master/packages/cra-template-pwa/template/src/serviceWorkerRegistration.js), which\n   demonstrates which service worker lifecycle events to listen for to detect each\n   scenario, and which as a default, only logs appropriate messages to the\n   JavaScript console.\n\n1. Service workers [require HTTPS](https://developers.google.com/web/fundamentals/getting-started/primers/service-workers#you_need_https),\n   although to facilitate local testing, that policy\n   [does not apply to `localhost`](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/34160509/options-for-testing-service-workers-via-http/34161385#34161385).\n   If your production web server does not support HTTPS, then the service worker\n   registration will fail, but the rest of your web app will remain functional.\n\n1. The service worker is only enabled in the [production environment](deployment.md),\n   e.g. the output of `npm run build`. It's recommended that you do not enable an\n   offline-first service worker in a development environment, as it can lead to\n   frustration when previously cached assets are used and do not include the latest\n   changes you've made locally.\n\n1. If you _need_ to test your offline-first service worker locally, build\n   the application (using `npm run build`) and run a standard http server from your\n   build directory. After running the build script, `create-react-app` will give\n   instructions for one way to test your production build locally and the [deployment instructions](deployment.md) have\n   instructions for using other methods. _Be sure to always use an\n   incognito window to avoid complications with your browser cache._\n\n1. By default, the generated service worker file will not intercept or cache any\n   cross-origin traffic, like HTTP [API requests](integrating-with-an-api-backend.md),\n   images, or embeds loaded from a different domain. Starting with Create\n   React App 4, this can be customized, as explained above.\n\n## Progressive Web App Metadata\n\nThe default configuration includes a web app manifest located at\n[`public/manifest.json`](https://github.com/cra-template/pwa/blob/master/packages/cra-template-pwa/template/public/manifest.json), that you can customize with\ndetails specific to your web application.\n\nWhen a user adds a web app to their homescreen using Chrome or Firefox on\nAndroid, the metadata in [`manifest.json`](https://github.com/cra-template/pwa/blob/master/packages/cra-template-pwa/template/public/manifest.json) determines what\nicons, names, and branding colors to use when the web app is displayed.\n[The Web App Manifest guide](https://developers.google.com/web/fundamentals/engage-and-retain/web-app-manifest/)\nprovides more context about what each field means, and how your customizations\nwill affect your users' experience.\n\nProgressive web apps that have been added to the homescreen will load faster and\nwork offline when there's an active service worker. That being said, the\nmetadata from the web app manifest will still be used regardless of whether or\nnot you opt-in to service worker registration."

The [Browser\nSupport](https://github.com/GoogleChrome/web-vitals/#browser-support) section also explains which browsers are supported.\n\n## Sending results to analytics\n\nWith the `reportWebVitals` function, you can send any of results to an analytics endpoint to measure and track real user performance on your site. For example:\n\n```js\nfunction sendToAnalytics(metric) {\n  const body = JSON.stringify(metric);\n  const url = 'https://example.com/analytics';\n\n  // Use `navigator.sendBeacon()` if available, falling back to `fetch()`\n  if (navigator.sendBeacon) {\n    navigator.sendBeacon(url, body);\n  } else {\n    fetch(url, { body, method: 'POST', keepalive: true });\n  }\n}\n\nreportWebVitals(sendToAnalytics);\n```\n\n> **Note:** If you use Google Analytics, use the `id` value to make it easier to construct metric distributions manually (to calculate percentiles, etc…).\n>\n> ```js\n> function sendToAnalytics({ id, name, value }) {\n>   ga('send', 'event', {\n>     eventCategory: 'Web Vitals',\n>     eventAction: name,\n>     eventValue: Math.round(name === 'CLS' ? value * 1000 : value), // values must be integers\n>     eventLabel: id, // id unique to current page load\n>     nonInteraction: true, // avoids affecting bounce rate\n>   });\n> }\n>\n> reportWebVitals(sendToAnalytics);\n> ```\n>\n> Read more about sending results to Google Analytics [here](https://github.com/GoogleChrome/web-vitals#send-the-results-to-google-analytics)."

        "content": "---\nid: production-build\ntitle: Creating a Production Build\n---\n\n`npm run build` creates a `build` directory with a production build of your app. Inside the `build/static` directory will be your JavaScript and CSS files. Each filename inside of `build/static` will contain a unique hash of the file contents. This hash in the file name enables [long term caching techniques](#static-file-caching).\n\nWhen running a production build of freshly created Create React App application, there are a number of `.js` files (called _chunks_) that are generated and placed in the `build/static/js` directory:\n\n`main.[hash].chunk.js`\n\n- This is your _application_ code. `App.js`, etc.\n\n`[number].[hash].chunk.js`\n\n- These files can either be _vendor_ code, or [code splitting chunks](code-splitting.md). _Vendor_ code includes modules that you've imported from within `node_modules`. One of the potential advantages with splitting your _vendor_ and _application_ code is to enable [long term caching techniques](#static-file-caching) to improve application loading performance. Since _vendor_ code tends to change less often than the actual _application_ code, the browser will be able to cache them separately, and won't re-download them each time the app code changes.\n\n`runtime-main.[hash].js`\n\n- This is a small chunk of [webpack runtime](https://webpack.js.org/configuration/optimization/#optimization-runtimechunk) logic which is used to load and run your application. The contents of this will be embedded in your `build/index.html` file by default to save an additional network request. You can opt out of this by specifying `INLINE_RUNTIME_CHUNK=false` as documented in our [advanced configuration](advanced-configuration.md), which will load this chunk instead of embedding it in your `index.html`.\n\nIf you're using [code splitting](code-splitting.md) to split up your application, this will create additional chunks in the `build/static` folder as well.\n\n## Static File Caching\n\nEach file inside of the `build/static` directory will have a unique hash appended to the filename that is generated based on the contents of the file, which allows you to use [aggressive caching techniques](https://developers.google.com/web/fundamentals/performance/optimizing-content-efficiency/http-caching#invalidating_and_updating_cached_responses) to avoid the browser re-downloading your assets if the file contents haven't changed. If the contents of a file changes in a subsequent build, the filename hash that is generated will be different.\n\nTo deliver the best performance to your users, it's best practice to specify a `Cache-Control` header for `index.html`, as well as the files within `build/static`. This header allows you to control the length of time that the browser as well as CDNs will cache your static assets. If you aren't familiar with what `Cache-Control` does, see [this article](https://jakearchibald.com/2016/caching-best-practices/) for a great introduction.\n\nUsing `Cache-Control: max-age=31536000` for your `build/static` assets, and `Cache-Control: no-cache` for everything else is a safe and effective starting point that ensures your user's browser will always check for an updated `index.html` file, and will cache all of the `build/static` files for one year. Note that you can use the one year expiration on `build/static` safely because the file contents hash is embedded into the filename.\n\n## Profiling\n\nReactDOM automatically supports profiling in development mode for v16.5+, but since profiling adds some small\nadditional overhead it is opt-in for production mode. You can opt-in by using the `--profile` flag. Use `npm run build -- --profile` or `yarn build --profile` to enable profiling in the production build. See the [React docs](https://reactjs.org/docs/optimizing-performance.html#profiling-components-with-the-devtools-profiler) for details about profiling\nusing the React DevTools."

        "content": "---\nid: proxying-api-requests-in-development\ntitle: Proxying API Requests in Development\nsidebar_label: Proxying in Development\n---\n\n> Note: this feature is available with `react-scripts@0.2.3` and higher.\n\nPeople often serve the front-end React app from the same host and port as their backend implementation.\n\nFor example, a production setup might look like this after the app is deployed:\n\n    /             - static server returns index.html with React app\n    /todos        - static server returns index.html with React app\n    /api/todos    - server handles any /api/* requests using the backend implementation\n\nSuch setup is **not** required. However, if you **do** have a setup like this, it is convenient to write requests like `fetch('/api/todos')` without worrying about redirecting them to another host or port during development.\n\nTo tell the development server to proxy any unknown requests to your API server in development, add a `proxy` field to your `package.json`, for example:\n\n```json\n  \"proxy\": \"http://localhost:4000\",\n```\n\nThis way, when you `fetch('/api/todos')` in development, the development server will recognize that it’s not a static asset, and will proxy your request to `http://localhost:4000/api/todos` as a fallback. The development server will **only** attempt to send requests without `text/html` in its `Accept` header to the proxy.\n\nConveniently, this avoids [CORS issues](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/21854516/understanding-ajax-cors-and-security-considerations) and error messages like this in development:\n\n```\nFetch API cannot load http://localhost:4000/api/todos. No 'Access-Control-Allow-Origin' header is present on the requested resource. Origin 'http://localhost:3000' is therefore not allowed access. If an opaque response serves your needs, set the request's mode to 'no-cors' to fetch the resource with CORS disabled.\n```\n\nKeep in mind that `proxy` only has effect in development (with `npm start`), and it is up to you to ensure that URLs like `/api/todos` point to the right thing in production. You don’t have to use the `/api` prefix. Any unrecognized request without a `text/html` accept header will be redirected to the specified `proxy`.\n\nThe `proxy` option supports HTTP, HTTPS and WebSocket connections.\n\nIf the `proxy` option is **not** flexible enough for you, alternatively you can:\n\n- [Configure the proxy yourself](#configuring-the-proxy-manually)\n- Enable CORS on your server ([here’s how to do it for Express](https://enable-cors.org/server_expressjs.html)).\n- Use [environment variables](adding-custom-environment-variables.md) to inject the right server host and port into your app.\n\n## \"Invalid Host Header\" Errors After Configuring Proxy\n\nWhen you enable the `proxy` option, you opt into a more strict set of host checks. This is necessary because leaving the backend open to remote hosts makes your computer vulnerable to DNS rebinding attacks. The issue is explained in [this article](https://medium.com/webpack/webpack-dev-server-middleware-security-issues-1489d950874a) and [this issue](https://github.com/webpack/webpack-dev-server/issues/887).\n\nThis shouldn’t affect you when developing on `localhost`, but if you develop remotely like [described here](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app/issues/2271), you will see this error in the browser after enabling the `proxy` option:\n\n> Invalid Host header\n\nTo work around it, you can specify your public development host in a file called `.env.development` in the root of your project:\n\n```\nHOST=mypublicdevhost.com\n```\n\nIf you restart the development server now and load the app from the specified host, it should work.\n\nIf you are still having issues or if you’re using a more exotic environment like a cloud editor, you can bypass the host check completely by adding a line to `.env.development.local`. **Note that this is dangerous and exposes your machine to remote code execution from malicious websites:**\n\n```\n# NOTE: THIS IS DANGEROUS!\n# It exposes your machine to attacks from the websites you visit.\nDANGEROUSLY_DISABLE_HOST_CHECK=true\n```\n\nWe don’t recommend this approach.\n\n## Configuring the Proxy Manually\n\n> Note: this feature is available with `react-scripts@2.0.0` and higher.\n\nIf the `proxy` option is **not** flexible enough for you, you can get direct access to the Express app instance and hook up your own proxy middleware.\n\nYou can use this feature in conjunction with the `proxy` property in `package.json`, but it is recommended you consolidate all of your logic into `src/setupProxy.js`.\n\nFirst, install `http-proxy-middleware` using npm or Yarn:\n\n```sh\n$ npm install http-proxy-middleware --save\n$ # or\n$ yarn add http-proxy-middleware\n```\n\nNext, create `src/setupProxy.js` and place the following contents in it:\n\n```js\nconst { createProxyMiddleware } = require('http-proxy-middleware');\n\nmodule.exports = function (app) {\n  // ...\n};\n```\n\nYou can now register proxies as you wish! Here's an example using the above `http-proxy-middleware`:\n\n```js\nconst { createProxyMiddleware } = require('http-proxy-middleware');\n\nmodule.exports = function (app) {\n  app.use(\n    '/api',\n    createProxyMiddleware({\n      target: 'http://localhost:5000',\n      changeOrigin: true,\n    })\n  );\n};\n```\n\n> **Note:** You do not need to import this file anywhere. It is automatically registered when you start the development server.\n\n> **Note:** This file only supports Node's JavaScript syntax. Be sure to only use supported language features (i.e. no support for Flow, ES Modules, etc).\n\n> **Note:** Passing the path to the proxy function allows you to use globbing and/or pattern matching on the path, which is more flexible than the express route matching."

        "path": "docusaurus/docs/running-tests.md",
        "content": "---\nid: running-tests\ntitle: Running Tests\n---\n\n> Note: this feature is available with `react-scripts@0.3.0` and higher.\n\n> [Read the migration guide to learn how to enable it in older projects!](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app/blob/main/CHANGELOG-0.x.md#migrating-from-023-to-030)\n\nCreate React App uses [Jest](https://jestjs.io/) as its test runner. To prepare for this integration, we did a [major revamp](https://jestjs.io/blog/2016/09/01/jest-15.html) of Jest so if you heard bad things about it years ago, give it another try.\n\nJest is a Node-based runner. This means that the tests always run in a Node environment and not in a real browser. This lets us enable fast iteration speed and prevent flakiness.\n\nWhile Jest provides browser globals such as `window` thanks to [jsdom](https://github.com/tmpvar/jsdom), they are only approximations of the real browser behavior. Jest is intended to be used for unit tests of your logic and your components rather than the DOM quirks.\n\nWe recommend that you use a separate tool for browser end-to-end tests if you need them. They are beyond the scope of Create React App.\n\n## Filename Conventions\n\nJest will look for test files with any of the following popular naming conventions:\n\n- Files with `.js` suffix in `__tests__` folders.\n- Files with `.test.js` suffix.\n- Files with `.spec.js` suffix.\n\nThe `.test.js` / `.spec.js` files (or the `__tests__` folders) can be located at any depth under the `src` top level folder.\n\nWe recommend to put the test files (or `__tests__` folders) next to the code they are testing so that relative imports appear shorter. For example, if `App.test.js` and `App.js` are in the same folder, the test only needs to `import App from './App'` instead of a long relative path. Collocation also helps find tests more quickly in larger projects.\n\n## Command Line Interface\n\nWhen you run `npm test`, Jest will launch in watch mode<sup>\\*</sup>. Every time you save a file, it will re-run the tests, like how `npm start` recompiles the code.\n\nThe watcher includes an interactive command-line interface with the ability to run all tests, or focus on a search pattern. It is designed this way so that you can keep it open and enjoy fast re-runs. You can learn the commands from the “Watch Usage” note that the watcher prints after every run:\n\n![Jest watch mode](https://jestjs.io/img/blog/15-watch.gif)\n\n> \\*Although we recommend running your tests in watch mode during development, you can disable this behavior by passing in the `--watchAll=false` flag. In most CI environments, this is handled for you (see [On CI servers](#on-ci-servers)).\n\n## Version Control Integration\n\nBy default, when you run `npm test`, Jest will only run the tests related to files changed since the last commit. This is an optimization designed to make your tests run fast regardless of how many tests you have. However it assumes that you don’t often commit the code that doesn’t pass the tests.\n\nJest will always explicitly mention that it only ran tests related to the files changed since the last commit. You can also press `a` in the watch mode to force Jest to run all tests.\n\nJest will always run all tests on a [continuous integration](#continuous-integration) server or if the project is not inside a Git or Mercurial repository.\n\n## Writing Tests\n\nTo create tests, add `it()` (or `test()`) blocks with the name of the test and its code. You may optionally wrap them in `describe()` blocks for logical grouping but this is neither required nor recommended.\n\nJest provides a built-in `expect()` global function for making assertions. A basic test could look like this:\n\n```js\nimport sum from './sum';\n\nit('sums numbers', () => {\n  expect(sum(1, 2)).toEqual(3);\n  expect(sum(2, 2)).toEqual(4);\n});\n```\n\nAll `expect()` matchers supported by Jest are [extensively documented here](https://jestjs.io/docs/expect).\n\nYou can also use [`jest.fn()` and `expect(fn).toBeCalled()`](https://jestjs.io/docs/expect#tohavebeencalled) to create “spies” or mock functions.\n\n## Testing Components\n\nThere is a broad spectrum of component testing techniques. They range from a “smoke test” verifying that a component renders without throwing, to shallow rendering and testing some of the output, to full rendering and testing component lifecycle and state changes.\n\nDifferent projects choose different testing tradeoffs based on how often components change, and how much logic they contain. If you haven’t decided on a testing strategy yet, we recommend that you start with creating basic smoke tests for your components:\n\n```js\nimport React from 'react';\nimport ReactDOMClient from 'react-dom/client';\nimport App from './App';\n\nit('renders without crashing', () => {\n  const div = document.createElement('div');\n  ReactDOMClient.createRoot(div).render(<App />);\n});\n```\n\nThis test mounts a component and makes sure that it didn’t throw during rendering. Tests like this provide a lot of value with very little effort so they are great as a starting point, and this is the test you will find in `src/App.test.js`.\n\nWhen you encounter bugs caused by changing components, you will gain a deeper insight into which parts of them are worth testing in your application. This might be a good time to introduce more specific tests asserting specific expected output or behavior.\n\n### React Testing Library\n\nIf you’d like to test components in isolation from the child components they render, we recommend using `react-testing-library`. [`react-testing-library`](https://github.com/testing-library/react-testing-library) is a library for testing React components in a way that resembles the way the components are used by end users. It is well suited for unit, integration, and end-to-end testing of React components and applications. It works more directly with DOM nodes, and therefore it's recommended to use with [`jest-dom`](https://github.com/testing-library/jest-dom) for improved assertions.\n\nTo install `react-testing-library` and `jest-dom`, you can run:\n\n```sh\nnpm install --save @testing-library/react @testing-library/dom @testing-library/jest-dom\n```\n\nAlternatively you may use `yarn`:\n\n```sh\nyarn add @testing-library/react @testing-library/dom @testing-library/jest-dom\n```\n\nIf you want to avoid boilerplate in your test files, you can create a [`src/setupTests.js`](#initializing-test-environment) file:\n\n```js\n// react-testing-library renders your components to document.body,\n// this adds jest-dom's custom assertions\nimport '@testing-library/jest-dom';\n```\n\nHere's an example of using `react-testing-library` and `jest-dom` for testing that the `<App />` component renders \"Learn React\".\n\n```js\nimport React from 'react';\nimport { render, screen } from '@testing-library/react';\nimport App from './App';\n\nit('renders welcome message', () => {\n  render(<App />);\n  expect(screen.getByText('Learn React')).toBeInTheDocument();\n});\n```\n\nLearn more about the utilities provided by `react-testing-library` to facilitate testing asynchronous interactions as well as selecting form elements from the [`react-testing-library` documentation](https://testing-library.com/react) and [examples](https://codesandbox.io/s/github/kentcdodds/react-testing-library-examples).\n\n## Using Third Party Assertion Libraries\n\nWe recommend that you use `expect()` for assertions and `jest.fn()` for spies. If you are having issues with them please [file those against Jest](https://github.com/facebook/jest/issues/new), and we’ll fix them. We intend to keep making them better for React, supporting, for example, [pretty-printing React elements as JSX](https://github.com/facebook/jest/pull/1566).\n\nHowever, if you are used to other libraries, such as [Chai](https://www.chaijs.com/) and [Sinon](https://sinonjs.org/), or if you have existing code using them that you’d like to port over, you can import them normally like this:\n\n```js\nimport sinon from 'sinon';\nimport { expect } from 'chai';\n```\n\nand then use them in your tests like you normally do.\n\n## Initializing Test Environment\n\n> Note: this feature is available with `react-scripts@0.4.0` and higher.\n\nIf your app uses a browser API that you need to mock in your tests or if you need a global setup before running your tests, add a `src/setupTests.js` to your project. It will be automatically executed before running your tests.\n\nFor example:\n\n### `src/setupTests.js`\n\n```js\nconst localStorageMock = {\n  getItem: jest.fn(),\n  setItem: jest.fn(),\n  removeItem: jest.fn(),\n  clear: jest.fn(),\n};\nglobal.localStorage = localStorageMock;\n```\n\n> Note: Keep in mind that if you decide to \"eject\" before creating `src/setupTests.js`, the resulting `package.json` file won't contain any reference to it, so you should manually create the property `setupFilesAfterEnv` in the configuration for Jest, something like the following:\n\n> ```js\n> \"jest\": {\n>   // ...\n>   \"setupFilesAfterEnv\": [\"<rootDir>/src/setupTests.js\"]\n>  }\n> ```\n\n## Focusing and Excluding Tests\n\nYou can replace `it()` with `xit()` to temporarily exclude a test from being executed.\n\nSimilarly, `fit()` lets you focus on a specific test without running any other tests.\n\n## Coverage Reporting\n\nJest has an integrated coverage reporter that works well with ES6 and requires no configuration.\n\nRun `npm test -- --coverage` (note extra `--` in the middle) to include a coverage report like this:\n\n![coverage report](https://i.imgur.com/5bFhnTS.png)\n\nNote that tests run much slower with coverage so it is recommended to run it separately from your normal workflow.\n\n### Configuration\n\nThe [default configuration](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app/blob/main/packages/react-scripts/scripts/utils/createJestConfig.js) that Create React App uses for Jest can be overridden by adding any of the following supported keys to a Jest config in your package.json.\n\nSupported overrides:\n\n- [`clearMocks`](https://jestjs.io/docs/configuration#clearmocks-boolean)\n- [`collectCoverageFrom`](https://jestjs.io/docs/configuration#collectcoveragefrom-array)\n- [`coveragePathIgnorePatterns`](https://jestjs.io/docs/configuration#coveragepathignorepatterns-arraystring)\n- [`coverageReporters`](https://jestjs.io/docs/configuration#coveragereporters-arraystring--string-options)\n- [`coverageThreshold`](https://jestjs.io/docs/configuration#coveragethreshold-object)\n- [`displayName`](https://jestjs.io/docs/configuration#displayname-string-object)\n- [`extraGlobals`](https://jestjs.io/docs/configuration#extraglobals-arraystring)\n- [`globalSetup`](https://jestjs.io/docs/configuration#globalsetup-string)\n- [`globalTeardown`](https://jestjs.io/docs/configuration#globalteardown-string)\n- [`moduleNameMapper`](https://jestjs.io/docs/configuration#modulenamemapper-objectstring-string--arraystring)\n- [`resetMocks`](https://jestjs.io/docs/configuration#resetmocks-boolean)\n- [`resetModules`](https://jestjs.io/docs/configuration#resetmodules-boolean)\n- [`restoreMocks`](https://jestjs.io/docs/configuration#restoremocks-boolean)\n- [`snapshotSerializers`](https://jestjs.io/docs/configuration#snapshotserializers-arraystring)\n- [`testMatch`](https://jestjs.io/docs/configuration#testmatch-arraystring)\n- [`transform`](https://jestjs.io/docs/configuration#transform-objectstring-pathtotransformer--pathtotransformer-object)\n- [`transformIgnorePatterns`](https://jestjs.io/docs/configuration#transformignorepatterns-arraystring)\n- [`watchPathIgnorePatterns`](https://jestjs.io/docs/configuration#watchpathignorepatterns-arraystring)\n\nExample package.json:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"name\": \"your-package\",\n  \"jest\": {\n    \"collectCoverageFrom\": [\n      \"src/**/*.{js,jsx,ts,tsx}\",\n      \"!<rootDir>/node_modules/\",\n      \"!<rootDir>/path/to/dir/\"\n    ],\n    \"coverageThreshold\": {\n      \"global\": {\n        \"branches\": 90,\n        \"functions\": 90,\n        \"lines\": 90,\n        \"statements\": 90\n      }\n    },\n    \"coverageReporters\": [\"text\"],\n    \"snapshotSerializers\": [\"my-serializer-module\"]\n  }\n}\n```\n\n## Continuous Integration\n\nBy default `npm test` runs the watcher with interactive CLI. However, you can force it to run tests once and finish the process by setting an environment variable called `CI`.\n\nWhen creating a build of your application with `npm run build` linter warnings are not checked by default. Like `npm test`, you can force the build to perform a linter warning check by setting the environment variable `CI`. If any warnings are encountered then the build fails.\n\nPopular CI servers already set the environment variable `CI` by default but you can do this yourself too:\n\n## On CI servers\n\n### Travis CI\n\n1. Following the [Travis Getting started](https://docs.travis-ci.com/user/getting-started/) guide for syncing your GitHub repository with Travis. You may need to initialize some settings manually in your [profile](https://travis-ci.org/profile) page.\n2. Add a `.travis.yml` file to your git repository.\n\n```yaml\nlanguage: node_js\nnode_js:\n  - 8\ncache:\n  directories:\n    - node_modules\nscript:\n  - npm run build\n  - npm test\n```\n\n3. Trigger your first build with a git push.\n4. [Customize your Travis CI Build](https://docs.travis-ci.com/user/customizing-the-build/) if needed.\n\n### CircleCI\n\nFollow [this article](https://medium.com/@knowbody/circleci-and-zeits-now-sh-c9b7eebcd3c1) to set up CircleCI with a Create React App project.\n\n## On your own environment\n\n#### Windows (cmd.exe)\n\n```cmd\nset CI=true&&npm test\n```\n\n```cmd\nset CI=true&&npm run build\n```\n\n(Note: the lack of whitespace is intentional.)\n\n#### Windows (Powershell)\n\n```Powershell\n($env:CI = \"true\") -and (npm test)\n```\n\n```Powershell\n($env:CI = \"true\") -and (npm run build)\n```\n\n#### Linux, macOS (Bash)\n\n```sh\nCI=true npm test\n```\n\n```sh\nCI=true npm run build\n```\n\nThe test command will force Jest to run in CI-mode, and tests will only run once instead of launching the watcher.\n\nFor non-CI environments, you can pass the `--watchAll=false` flag to disable test-watching.\n\nThe build command will check for linter warnings and fail if any are found.\n\n## Disabling jsdom\n\nIf you know that none of your tests depend on [jsdom](https://github.com/tmpvar/jsdom), you can safely set `--env=node`, and your tests will run faster:\n\n```diff\n  \"scripts\": {\n    \"start\": \"react-scripts start\",\n    \"build\": \"react-scripts build\",\n-   \"test\": \"react-scripts test\"\n+   \"test\": \"react-scripts test --env=node\"\n```\n\nTo help you make up your mind, here is a list of APIs that **need jsdom**:\n\n- Any browser globals like `window` and `document`\n- [`ReactDOM.render()`](https://facebook.github.io/react/docs/top-level-api.html#reactdom.render)\n- [`TestUtils.renderIntoDocument()`](https://facebook.github.io/react/docs/test-utils.html#renderintodocument) ([a shortcut](https://github.com/facebook/react/blob/34761cf9a252964abfaab6faf74d473ad95d1f21/src/test/ReactTestUtils.js#L83-L91) for the above)\n- [`mount()`](https://airbnb.io/enzyme/docs/api/mount.html) in [Enzyme](https://airbnb.io/enzyme/index.html)\n- [`render()`](https://testing-library.com/docs/react-testing-library/api/#render) in [React Testing Library](https://testing-library.com/docs/react-testing-library/intro/)\n\nIn contrast, **jsdom is not needed** for the following APIs:\n\n- [`TestUtils.createRenderer()`](https://facebook.github.io/react/docs/test-utils.html#shallow-rendering) (shallow rendering)\n- [`shallow()`](https://airbnb.io/enzyme/docs/api/shallow.html) in [Enzyme](https://airbnb.io/enzyme/index.html)\n\nFinally, jsdom is also not needed for [snapshot testing](https://jestjs.io/blog/2016/07/27/jest-14.html).\n\n## Snapshot Testing\n\nSnapshot testing is a feature of Jest that automatically generates text snapshots of your components and saves them on the disk so if the UI output changes, you get notified without manually writing any assertions on the component output. [Read more about snapshot testing.](https://jestjs.io/blog/2016/07/27/jest-14.html)\n\n## Editor Integration\n\nIf you use [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com), there is a [Jest extension](https://github.com/orta/vscode-jest) which works with Create React App out of the box. This provides a lot of IDE-like features while using a text editor: showing the status of a test run with potential fail messages inline, starting and stopping the watcher automatically, and offering one-click snapshot updates.\n\n![VS Code Jest Preview](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/49038/20795349/a032308a-b7c8-11e6-9b34-7eeac781003f.png)"

        "content": "---\nid: setting-up-your-editor\ntitle: Setting Up Your Editor\nsidebar_label: Editor Setup\n---\n\nCreate React App comes with a bunch of tools that improve the editing experience - if configured correctly. Here's a few tips to maximize your productivity:\n\n## Syntax highlighting\n\nTo configure the syntax highlighting in your favorite text editor, head to the [relevant Babel documentation page](https://babeljs.io/docs/editors) and follow the instructions. Some of the most popular editors are covered.\n\n## Displaying Lint Output in the Editor\n\n> Note: this feature is available with `react-scripts@0.2.0` and higher.\n\n> It works out of the box for newly created projects with `react-scripts@2.0.3` and higher.\n\n> It also only works with npm 3 or higher.\n\nSome editors, including Sublime Text, Atom, and Visual Studio Code, provide plugins for ESLint.\n\nThey are not required for linting. You should see the linter output right in your terminal as well as the browser console. If you prefer the lint results to appear right in your editor, please make sure you install an ESLint plugin/extension.\n\nNote that even if you customise your ESLint config, these changes will **only affect the editor integration**. They won’t affect the terminal and in-browser lint output. This is because Create React App intentionally provides a minimal set of rules that find common mistakes.\n\nIf you want to enforce a coding style for your project, consider using [Prettier](https://github.com/jlongster/prettier) instead of ESLint style rules.\n\n### Extending or replacing the default ESLint config\n\nYou can extend our base ESLint config, or replace it completely if you need.\n\nThere are a few things to remember:\n\n1. We highly recommend extending the base config, as removing it could introduce hard-to-find issues.\n1. When working with TypeScript, you'll need to provide an `overrides` object for rules that should _only_ target TypeScript files.\n1. It's important to note that any rules that are set to `\"error\"` will stop the project from building.\n\nIn the below example:\n\n- the base config has been extended by a shared ESLint config,\n- a new rule has been set that applies to all JavaScript and TypeScript files, and\n- a new rule has been set that only targets TypeScript files.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"eslintConfig\": {\n    \"extends\": [\"react-app\", \"shared-config\"],\n    \"rules\": {\n      \"additional-rule\": \"warn\"\n    },\n    \"overrides\": [\n      {\n        \"files\": [\"**/*.ts?(x)\"],\n        \"rules\": {\n          \"additional-typescript-only-rule\": \"warn\"\n        }\n      }\n    ]\n  }\n}\n```\n\n## Debugging in the Editor\n\n**This feature is currently only supported by [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com) and [WebStorm](https://www.jetbrains.com/webstorm/).**\n\nVisual Studio Code and WebStorm support debugging out of the box with Create React App. This enables you as a developer to write and debug your React code without leaving the editor, and most importantly it enables you to have a continuous development workflow, where context switching is minimal, as you don’t have to switch between tools.\n\n### Visual Studio Code\n\nYou need to have the latest version of [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com) installed.\n\nThen add the block below to your `launch.json` file and put it inside the `.vscode` folder in your app’s root directory.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"version\": \"0.2.0\",\n  \"configurations\": [\n    {\n      \"name\": \"Chrome\",\n      \"type\": \"chrome\",\n      \"request\": \"launch\",\n      \"url\": \"http://localhost:3000\",\n      \"webRoot\": \"${workspaceFolder}/src\",\n      \"sourceMapPathOverrides\": {\n        \"webpack:///src/*\": \"${webRoot}/*\"\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```\n\n> Note: the URL may be different if you've made adjustments via the [HOST or PORT environment variables](advanced-configuration.md).\n\nStart your app by running `npm start`, and start debugging in VS Code by pressing `F5` or by clicking the green debug icon. You can now write code, set breakpoints, make changes to the code, and debug your newly modified code—all from your editor.\n\nHaving problems with VS Code Debugging? Please see their [troubleshooting guide](https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode-chrome-debug/blob/master/README.md#troubleshooting).\n\n### WebStorm\n\nYou need to have [WebStorm](https://www.jetbrains.com/webstorm/) and [JetBrains IDE Support](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/jetbrains-ide-support/hmhgeddbohgjknpmjagkdomcpobmllji) Chrome extension installed.\n\nIn the WebStorm menu `Run` select `Edit Configurations...`. Then click `+` and select `JavaScript Debug`. Paste `http://localhost:3000` into the URL field and save the configuration.\n\n> Note: the URL may be different if you've made adjustments via the [HOST or PORT environment variables](advanced-configuration.md).\n\nStart your app by running `npm start`, then press `^D` on macOS or `F9` on Windows and Linux or click the green debug icon to start debugging in WebStorm.\n\nThe same way you can debug your application in IntelliJ IDEA Ultimate, PhpStorm, PyCharm Pro, and RubyMine.\n\n## Formatting Code Automatically\n\nPrettier is an opinionated code formatter with support for JavaScript, CSS and JSON. With Prettier you can format the code you write automatically to ensure a code style within your project. See [Prettier's GitHub page](https://github.com/prettier/prettier) for more information, and look at this [page to see it in action](https://prettier.io/playground/).\n\nTo format our code whenever we make a commit in git, we need to install the following dependencies:\n\n```sh\nnpm install --save husky lint-staged prettier\n```\n\nAlternatively you may use `yarn`:\n\n```sh\nyarn add husky lint-staged prettier\n```\n\n- `husky` makes it possible to use githooks as if they are npm scripts.\n- `lint-staged` allows us to run scripts on staged files in git. See this [blog post about lint-staged to learn more about it](https://medium.com/@okonetchnikov/make-linting-great-again-f3890e1ad6b8).\n- `prettier` is the JavaScript formatter we will run before commits.\n\nNow we can make sure every file is formatted correctly by adding a few lines to the `package.json` in the project root.\n\nAdd the following field to the `package.json` section:\n\n```diff\n+  \"husky\": {\n+    \"hooks\": {\n+      \"pre-commit\": \"lint-staged\"\n+    }\n+  }\n```\n\nNext we add a 'lint-staged' field to the `package.json`, for example:\n\n```diff\n  \"dependencies\": {\n    // ...\n  },\n+ \"lint-staged\": {\n+   \"src/**/*.{js,jsx,ts,tsx,json,css,scss,md}\": [\n+     \"prettier --write\"\n+   ]\n+ },\n  \"scripts\": {\n```\n\nNow, whenever you make a commit, Prettier will format the changed files automatically. You can also run `./node_modules/.bin/prettier --write \"src/**/*.{js,jsx,ts,tsx,json,css,scss,md}\"` to format your entire project for the first time.\n\nNext you might want to integrate Prettier in your favorite editor. Read the section on [Editor Integration](https://prettier.io/docs/en/editors.html) on the Prettier GitHub page."

        "content": "---\nid: supported-browsers-features\ntitle: Supported Browsers and Features\nsidebar_label: Supported Browsers and Features\n---\n\n## Supported Browsers\n\nBy default, the generated project supports all modern browsers. Support for Internet Explorer 9, 10, and 11 requires polyfills. For a set of polyfills to support older browsers, use [react-app-polyfill](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app/blob/main/packages/react-app-polyfill/README.md).\n\n## Supported Language Features\n\nThis project supports a superset of the latest JavaScript standard. In addition to [ES6](https://github.com/lukehoban/es6features) syntax features, it also supports:\n\n- [Exponentiation Operator](https://github.com/rwaldron/exponentiation-operator) (ES2016).\n- [Async/await](https://github.com/tc39/ecmascript-asyncawait) (ES2017).\n- [Object Rest/Spread Properties](https://github.com/tc39/proposal-object-rest-spread) (ES2018).\n- [Dynamic import()](https://github.com/tc39/proposal-dynamic-import) (stage 4 proposal)\n- [Class Fields and Static Properties](https://github.com/tc39/proposal-class-public-fields) (part of stage 3 proposal).\n- [JSX](https://facebook.github.io/react/docs/introducing-jsx.html), [Flow](./adding-flow) and [TypeScript](./adding-typescript).\n\nLearn more about [different proposal stages](https://tc39.github.io/process-document/).\n\nWhile we recommend using experimental proposals with some caution, Facebook heavily uses these features in the product code, so we intend to provide [codemods](https://medium.com/@cpojer/effective-javascript-codemods-5a6686bb46fb) if any of these proposals change in the future.\n\nNote that **this project includes no [polyfills](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app/blob/main/packages/react-app-polyfill/README.md)** by default.\n\nIf you use any other ES6+ features that need **runtime support** (such as `Array.from()` or `Symbol`), make sure you are [including the appropriate polyfills manually](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app/blob/main/packages/react-app-polyfill/README.md), or that the browsers you are targeting already support them.\n\n## Configuring Supported Browsers\n\nBy default, the generated project includes a [`browserslist`](https://github.com/browserslist/browserslist) configuration in your `package.json` file to target a broad range of browsers based on global usage (`> 0.2%`) for production builds, and modern browsers for development. This gives a good development experience, especially when using language features such as async/await, but still provides high compatibility with many browsers in production.\n\nThe `browserslist` configuration controls the outputted JavaScript so that the emitted code will be compatible with the browsers specified. The `production` list will be used when creating a production build by running the `build` script, and the `development` list will be used when running the `start` script. You can use [https://browserl.ist](https://browserl.ist/?q=%3E+0.2%25%2C+not+dead%2C+not+op_mini+all) to see the browsers supported by your configured `browserslist`.\n\nHere is an example `browserslist` that is specified in `package.json`:\n\n```json\n\"browserslist\": {\n  \"production\": [\n    \">0.2%\",\n    \"not dead\",\n    \"not op_mini all\"\n  ],\n  \"development\": [\n    \"last 1 chrome version\",\n    \"last 1 firefox version\",\n    \"last 1 safari version\"\n  ]\n}\n```\n\n> Note that this does not include polyfills automatically for you. You will still need to polyfill language features (see above) as needed based on the browsers you are supporting.\n\n> When editing the `browserslist` config, you may notice that your changes don't get picked up right away. This is due to an [issue in babel-loader](https://github.com/babel/babel-loader/issues/690) not detecting the change in your `package.json`. A quick solution is to delete the `node_modules/.cache` folder and try again."

        "path": "docusaurus/docs/title-and-meta-tags.md",
        "content": "---\nid: title-and-meta-tags\ntitle: Title and Meta Tags\nsidebar_label: Title & Meta Tags\n---\n\n## Changing the title tag\n\nYou can find the source HTML file in the `public` folder of the generated project. You may edit the `<title>` tag in it to change the title from “React App” to anything else.\n\nNote that normally you wouldn’t edit files in the `public` folder very often. For example, [adding a stylesheet](adding-a-stylesheet.md) is done without touching the HTML.\n\nIf you need to dynamically update the page title based on the content, you can use the browser [`document.title`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Document/title) API. For more complex scenarios when you want to change the title from React components, you can use [React Helmet](https://github.com/nfl/react-helmet), a third party library.\n\nIf you use a custom server for your app in production and want to modify the title before it gets sent to the browser, you can follow advice in [this section](#generating-dynamic-meta-tags-on-the-server). Alternatively, you can pre-build each page as a static HTML file which then loads the JavaScript bundle, which is covered [here](pre-rendering-into-static-html-files.md).\n\n## Generating Dynamic `<meta>` Tags on the Server\n\nSince Create React App doesn’t support server rendering, you might be wondering how to make `<meta>` tags dynamic and reflect the current URL. To solve this, we recommend to add placeholders into the HTML, like this:\n\n```html\n<!DOCTYPE html>\n<html lang=\"en\">\n  <head>\n    <meta property=\"og:title\" content=\"__OG_TITLE__\" />\n    <meta property=\"og:description\" content=\"__OG_DESCRIPTION__\" />\n  </head>\n</html>\n```\n\nThen, on the server, regardless of the backend you use, you can read `index.html` into memory and replace `__OG_TITLE__`, `__OG_DESCRIPTION__`, and any other placeholders with values depending on the current URL. Make sure to sanitize and escape the interpolated values so that they are safe to embed into HTML!\n\nIf you use a Node server, you can even share the route matching logic between the client and the server. However duplicating it also works fine in basic cases.\n\n## Injecting Data from the Server into the Page\n\nSimilarly to the previous section, you can leave some placeholders in the HTML that inject global variables, for example:\n\n```js\n<!doctype html>\n<html lang=\"en\">\n  <head>\n    <script>\n      window.SERVER_DATA = __SERVER_DATA__;\n    </script>\n```\n\nThen, on the server, you can replace `__SERVER_DATA__` with a JSON of real data right before sending the response. The client code can then read `window.SERVER_DATA` to use it. **Make sure to [sanitize the JSON before sending it to the client](https://medium.com/node-security/the-most-common-xss-vulnerability-in-react-js-applications-2bdffbcc1fa0) as it makes your app vulnerable to XSS attacks.**"

        "content": "---\nid: troubleshooting\ntitle: Troubleshooting\nsidebar_label: Troubleshooting\n---\n\n## `npm start` doesn’t detect changes\n\nWhen you save a file while `npm start` is running, the browser should refresh with the updated code.\n\nIf this doesn’t happen, try one of the following workarounds:\n\n- Check that your file is imported by your entrypoint. TypeScript will show errors on any of your source files, but webpack only reloads your files if they are directly or indirectly imported by one of your entrypoints.\n- If your project is in a Dropbox folder, try moving it out.\n- If the watcher doesn’t see a file called `index.js` and you’re referencing it by the folder name, you [need to restart the watcher](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app/issues/1164) due to a webpack bug.\n- Some editors like Vim and IntelliJ have a “safe write” feature that currently breaks the watcher. You will need to disable it. Follow the instructions in [“Adjusting Your Text Editor”](https://webpack.js.org/guides/development/#adjusting-your-text-editor).\n- If your project path contains parentheses, try moving the project to a path without them. This is caused by a [webpack watcher bug](https://github.com/webpack/watchpack/issues/42).\n- On Linux and macOS, you might need to [tweak system settings](https://github.com/webpack/docs/wiki/troubleshooting#not-enough-watchers) to allow more watchers.\n- If the project runs inside a virtual machine such as (a Vagrant provisioned) VirtualBox, create an `.env` file in your project directory if it doesn’t exist, and add `CHOKIDAR_USEPOLLING=true` to it. This ensures that the next time you run `npm start`, the watcher uses the polling mode, as necessary inside a VM.\n\nIf none of these solutions help please leave a comment [in this thread](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app/issues/659).\n\n## `npm start` fail due to watch error\n\nIf you are using a Linux operating system and see an error similar to: `ENOSPC: System limit for number of file watchers reached`, you can fix the issue by increasing the `fs.inotify.max_user_watches` setting of your operating system.\n\nIf you are running Debian, RedHat, or another similar Linux distribution, run the following in a terminal:\n\n```sh\necho fs.inotify.max_user_watches=524288 | sudo tee -a /etc/sysctl.conf && sudo sysctl -p\n```\n\nIf you are running ArchLinux, run the following command instead:\n\n```sh\necho fs.inotify.max_user_watches=524288 | sudo tee /etc/sysctl.d/40-max-user-watches.conf && sudo sysctl --system\n```\n\nThen paste it in your terminal and press on enter to run it. You could find more information [here](https://github.com/guard/listen/wiki/Increasing-the-amount-of-inotify-watchers#the-technical-details).\n\n## `npm test` hangs or crashes on macOS Sierra\n\nIf you run `npm test` and the console gets stuck after printing `react-scripts test` to the console there might be a problem with your [Watchman](https://facebook.github.io/watchman/) installation as described in [facebook/create-react-app#713](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app/issues/713).\n\nWe recommend deleting `node_modules` in your project and running `npm install` (or `yarn` if you use it) first. If it doesn't help, you can try one of the numerous workarounds mentioned in these issues:\n\n- [facebook/jest#1767](https://github.com/facebook/jest/issues/1767)\n- [facebook/watchman#358](https://github.com/facebook/watchman/issues/358)\n- [ember-cli/ember-cli#6259](https://github.com/ember-cli/ember-cli/issues/6259)\n\nIt is reported that installing Watchman 4.7.0 or newer fixes the issue. If you use [Homebrew](https://brew.sh/), you can run these commands to update it:\n\n```\nwatchman shutdown-server\nbrew update\nbrew reinstall watchman\n```\n\nYou can find [other installation methods](https://facebook.github.io/watchman/docs/install.html#build-install) on the Watchman documentation page.\n\nIf this still doesn’t help, try running `launchctl unload -F ~/Library/LaunchAgents/com.github.facebook.watchman.plist`.\n\nThere are also reports that _uninstalling_ Watchman fixes the issue. So if nothing else helps, remove it from your system and try again.\n\n## `npm run build` exits too early\n\nIt is reported that `npm run build` can fail on machines with limited memory and no swap space, which is common in cloud environments. Even with small projects this command can increase RAM usage in your system by hundreds of megabytes, so if you have less than 1 GB of available memory your build is likely to fail with the following message:\n\n> The build failed because the process exited too early. This probably means the system ran out of memory or someone called `kill -9` on the process.\n\nIf you are completely sure that you didn't terminate the process, consider [adding some swap space](https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/how-to-add-swap-on-ubuntu-14-04) to the machine you’re building on, or build the project locally.\n\n## `npm run build` fails on Heroku\n\nThis may be a problem with case sensitive filenames.\nPlease refer to [this section](deployment.md#resolving-heroku-deployment-errors).\n\n## Moment.js locales are missing\n\nIf you use a [Moment.js](https://momentjs.com/), you might notice that only the English locale is available by default. This is because the locale files are large, and you probably only need a subset of [all the locales provided by Moment.js](https://momentjs.com/#multiple-locale-support).\n\nTo add a specific Moment.js locale to your bundle, you need to import it explicitly.\n\nFor example:\n\n```js\nimport moment from 'moment';\nimport 'moment/locale/fr';\n```\n\nIf you are importing multiple locales this way, you can later switch between them by calling `moment.locale()` with the locale name:\n\n```js\nimport moment from 'moment';\nimport 'moment/locale/fr';\nimport 'moment/locale/es';\n\n// ...\n\nmoment.locale('fr');\n```\n\nThis will only work for locales that have been explicitly imported before.\n\n## `npm run build` fails to minify\n\nBefore `react-scripts@2.0.0`, this problem was caused by third party `node_modules` using modern JavaScript features because the minifier couldn't handle them during the build. This has been solved by compiling standard modern JavaScript features inside `node_modules` in `react-scripts@2.0.0` and higher.\n\nIf you're seeing this error, you're likely using an old version of `react-scripts`. You can either fix it by avoiding a dependency that uses modern syntax, or by upgrading to `react-scripts@>=2.0.0` and following the migration instructions in the changelog."

One particular case where this could be useful is when using [the \"proxy\" feature](proxying-api-requests-in-development.md) to proxy requests to an API server when that API server is itself serving HTTPS.\n\nTo do this, set the `HTTPS` environment variable to `true`, then start the dev server as usual with `npm start`:\n\n### Windows (cmd.exe)\n\n```cmd\nset HTTPS=true&&npm start\n```\n\n(Note: the lack of whitespace is intentional.)\n\n### Windows (Powershell)\n\n```Powershell\n($env:HTTPS = \"true\") -and (npm start)\n```\n\n### Linux, macOS (Bash)\n\n```sh\nHTTPS=true npm start\n```\n\nNote that the server will use a self-signed certificate, so your web browser will almost definitely display a warning upon accessing the page.\n\n## Custom SSL certificate\n\nTo set a custom certificate, set the `SSL_CRT_FILE` and `SSL_KEY_FILE` environment variables to the path of the certificate and key files in the same way you do for `HTTPS` above. Note that you will also need to set `HTTPS=true`.\n\n### Linux, macOS (Bash)\n\n```bash\nHTTPS=true SSL_CRT_FILE=cert.crt SSL_KEY_FILE=cert.key npm start\n```\n\nTo avoid having to set the environment variable each time, you can either include in the `npm start` script like so:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"start\": \"HTTPS=true react-scripts start\"\n}\n```\n\nOr you can create a `.env` file with `HTTPS=true` set.\n[Learn more about environment variables in CRA](https://create-react-app.dev/docs/adding-custom-environment-variables)."

        "content": "---\nid: using-the-public-folder\ntitle: Using the Public Folder\n---\n\n> Note: this feature is available with `react-scripts@0.5.0` and higher.\n\n## Changing the HTML\n\nThe `public` folder contains the HTML file so you can tweak it, for example, to [set the page title](title-and-meta-tags.md).\nThe `<script>` tag with the compiled code will be added to it automatically during the build process.\n\n## Adding Assets Outside of the Module System\n\nYou can also add other assets to the `public` folder.\n\nNote that we normally encourage you to `import` assets in JavaScript files instead.\nFor example, see the sections on [adding a stylesheet](adding-a-stylesheet.md) and [adding images and fonts](adding-images-fonts-and-files.md).\nThis mechanism provides a number of benefits:\n\n- Scripts and stylesheets get minified and bundled together to avoid extra network requests.\n- Missing files cause compilation errors instead of 404 errors for your users.\n- Result filenames include content hashes so you don’t need to worry about browsers caching their old versions.\n\nHowever there is an **escape hatch** that you can use to add an asset outside of the module system.\n\nIf you put a file into the `public` folder, it will **not** be processed by webpack. Instead it will be copied into the build folder untouched. To reference assets in the `public` folder, you need to use an environment variable called `PUBLIC_URL`.\n\nInside `index.html`, you can use it like this:\n\n```html\n<link rel=\"icon\" href=\"%PUBLIC_URL%/favicon.ico\" />\n```\n\nOnly files inside the `public` folder will be accessible by `%PUBLIC_URL%` prefix. If you need to use a file from `src` or `node_modules`, you’ll have to copy it there to explicitly specify your intention to make this file a part of the build.\n\nWhen you run `npm run build`, Create React App will substitute `%PUBLIC_URL%` with a correct absolute path so your project works even if you use client-side routing or host it at a non-root URL.\n\nIn JavaScript code, you can use `process.env.PUBLIC_URL` for similar purposes:\n\n```js\nrender() {\n  // Note: this is an escape hatch and should be used sparingly!\n  // Normally we recommend using `import` for getting asset URLs\n  // as described in “Adding Images and Fonts” above this section.\n  return <img src={process.env.PUBLIC_URL + '/img/logo.png'} />;\n}\n```\n\nKeep in mind the downsides of this approach:\n\n- None of the files in `public` folder get post-processed or minified.\n- Missing files will not be called at compilation time, and will cause 404 errors for your users.\n- Result filenames won’t include content hashes so you’ll need to add query arguments or rename them every time they change.\n\n## When to Use the `public` Folder\n\nNormally we recommend importing [stylesheets](adding-a-stylesheet.md), [images, and fonts](adding-images-fonts-and-files.md) from JavaScript.\nThe `public` folder is useful as a workaround for a number of less common cases:\n\n- You need a file with a specific name in the build output, such as [`manifest.webmanifest`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Manifest).\n- You have thousands of images and need to dynamically reference their paths.\n- You want to include a small script like [`pace.js`](https://codebyzach.github.io/pace/docs/) outside of the bundled code.\n- Some libraries may be incompatible with webpack and you have no other option but to include it as a `<script>` tag.\n\nNote that if you add a `<script>` that declares global variables, you should read the topic [Using Global Variables](using-global-variables.md) in the next section which explains how to reference them."

        "content": "# babel-preset-react-app\n\nThis package includes the Babel preset used by [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).<br>\nPlease refer to its documentation:\n\n- [Getting Started](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/getting-started) – How to create a new app.\n- [User Guide](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/) – How to develop apps bootstrapped with Create React App.\n\n## Usage in Create React App Projects\n\nThe easiest way to use this configuration is with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app), which includes it by default. **You don’t need to install it separately in Create React App projects.**\n\n## Usage Outside of Create React App\n\nIf you want to use this Babel preset in a project not built with Create React App, you can install it with the following steps.\n\nFirst, [install Babel](https://babeljs.io/docs/setup/).\n\nThen install babel-preset-react-app.\n\n```sh\nnpm install babel-preset-react-app --save-dev\n```\n\nThen create a file named `.babelrc` with following contents in the root folder of your project:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"presets\": [\"react-app\"]\n}\n```\n\nThis preset uses the `useBuiltIns` option with [transform-object-rest-spread](https://babeljs.io/docs/plugins/transform-object-rest-spread/) and [transform-react-jsx](https://babeljs.io/docs/plugins/transform-react-jsx/), which assumes that `Object.assign` is available or polyfilled.\n\n## Usage with Flow\n\nMake sure you have a `.flowconfig` file at the root directory. You can also use the `flow` option on `.babelrc`:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"presets\": [[\"react-app\", { \"flow\": true, \"typescript\": false }]]\n}\n```\n\n## Usage with TypeScript\n\nMake sure you have a `tsconfig.json` file at the root directory. You can also use the `typescript` option on `.babelrc`:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"presets\": [[\"react-app\", { \"flow\": false, \"typescript\": true }]]\n}\n```\n\n## Absolute Runtime Paths\n\nAbsolute paths are enabled by default for imports. To use relative paths instead, set the `absoluteRuntime` option in `.babelrc` to `false`:\n\n```\n{\n  \"presets\": [[\"react-app\", { \"absoluteRuntime\": false }]]\n}\n```"

You can feed this list to a static analysis tool like ESLint to prevent their usage without an explicit `window.` qualifier.\n\n## Installation\n\n```sh\nnpm install --save confusing-browser-globals\n```\n\n## Usage\n\nIf you use Create React App, you don't need to configure anything, as this rule is already included in the default `eslint-config-react-app` preset.\n\nIf you maintain your own ESLint configuration, you can do this:\n\n```js\nconst restrictedGlobals = require('confusing-browser-globals');\n\nmodule.exports = {\n  rules: {\n    'no-restricted-globals': ['error'].concat(restrictedGlobals),\n  },\n};\n```\n\n## License\n\nMIT"

        "content": "# eslint-config-react-app\n\nThis package includes the shareable ESLint configuration used by [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).<br>\nPlease refer to its documentation:\n\n- [Getting Started](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/getting-started) – How to create a new app.\n- [User Guide](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/) – How to develop apps bootstrapped with Create React App.\n\n## Usage in Create React App Projects\n\nThe easiest way to use this configuration is with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app), which includes it by default.\n\n**You don’t need to install it separately in Create React App projects.**\n\n## Usage Outside of Create React App\n\nIf you want to use this ESLint configuration in a project not built with Create React App, you can install it with the following steps.\n\nFirst, install this package and ESLint.\n\n```sh\nnpm install --save-dev eslint-config-react-app eslint@^8.0.0\n```\n\nThen create a file named `.eslintrc.json` with following contents in the root folder of your project:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"extends\": \"react-app\"\n}\n```\n\nThat's it! You can override the settings from `eslint-config-react-app` by editing the `.eslintrc.json` file. Learn more about [configuring ESLint](https://eslint.org/docs/user-guide/configuring) on the ESLint website.\n\n## Jest rules\n\nThis config also ships with optional Jest rules for ESLint (based on [`eslint-plugin-jest`](https://github.com/jest-community/eslint-plugin-jest)).\n\nYou can enable these rules by adding the Jest config to the `extends` array in your ESLint config.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"extends\": [\"react-app\", \"react-app/jest\"]\n}\n```\n\n## Accessibility Checks\n\nThe following rules from the [eslint-plugin-jsx-a11y](https://github.com/evcohen/eslint-plugin-jsx-a11y) plugin are activated:\n\n- [alt-text](https://github.com/evcohen/eslint-plugin-jsx-a11y/blob/master/docs/rules/alt-text.md)\n- [anchor-has-content](https://github.com/evcohen/eslint-plugin-jsx-a11y/blob/master/docs/rules/anchor-has-content.md)\n- [aria-activedescendant-has-tabindex](https://github.com/evcohen/eslint-plugin-jsx-a11y/blob/master/docs/rules/aria-activedescendant-has-tabindex.md)\n- [aria-props](https://github.com/evcohen/eslint-plugin-jsx-a11y/blob/master/docs/rules/aria-props.md)\n- [aria-proptypes](https://github.com/evcohen/eslint-plugin-jsx-a11y/blob/master/docs/rules/aria-proptypes.md)\n- [aria-role](https://github.com/evcohen/eslint-plugin-jsx-a11y/blob/master/docs/rules/aria-role.md)\n- [aria-unsupported-elements](https://github.com/evcohen/eslint-plugin-jsx-a11y/blob/master/docs/rules/aria-unsupported-elements.md)\n- [heading-has-content](https://github.com/evcohen/eslint-plugin-jsx-a11y/blob/master/docs/rules/heading-has-content.md)\n- [href-no-hash](https://github.com/evcohen/eslint-plugin-jsx-a11y/blob/v5.1.1/docs/rules/href-no-hash.md)\n- [iframe-has-title](https://github.com/evcohen/eslint-plugin-jsx-a11y/blob/master/docs/rules/iframe-has-title.md)\n- [img-redundant-alt](https://github.com/evcohen/eslint-plugin-jsx-a11y/blob/master/docs/rules/img-redundant-alt.md)\n- [no-access-key](https://github.com/evcohen/eslint-plugin-jsx-a11y/blob/master/docs/rules/no-access-key.md)\n- [no-distracting-elements](https://github.com/evcohen/eslint-plugin-jsx-a11y/blob/master/docs/rules/no-distracting-elements.md)\n- [no-redundant-roles](https://github.com/evcohen/eslint-plugin-jsx-a11y/blob/master/docs/rules/no-redundant-roles.md)\n- [role-has-required-aria-props](https://github.com/evcohen/eslint-plugin-jsx-a11y/blob/master/docs/rules/role-has-required-aria-props.md)\n- [role-supports-aria-props](https://github.com/evcohen/eslint-plugin-jsx-a11y/blob/master/docs/rules/role-supports-aria-props.md)\n- [scope](https://github.com/evcohen/eslint-plugin-jsx-a11y/blob/master/docs/rules/scope.md)\n\nIf you want to enable even more accessibility rules, you can create an `.eslintrc.json` file in the root of your project with this content:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"extends\": [\"react-app\", \"plugin:jsx-a11y/recommended\"],\n  \"plugins\": [\"jsx-a11y\"]\n}\n```\n\nHowever, if you are using [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app) and have not ejected, any additional rules will only be displayed in the [IDE integrations](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/setting-up-your-editor#displaying-lint-output-in-the-editor), but not in the browser or the terminal."

If you're using this in Create React App, it will automatically use the `browserslist` you've defined to only include polyfills needed by your target browsers when importing the `stable` polyfill. **Make sure to follow the Internet Explorer steps above if you need to support Internet Explorer in your application**.\n\n```js\n// This must be the first line in src/index.js\nimport 'react-app-polyfill/stable';\n\n// ...\n```\n\nIf you are supporting Internet Explorer 9 or Internet Explorer 11 you should include both the `ie9` or `ie11` and `stable` modules:\n\nFor IE9:\n\n```js\n// These must be the first lines in src/index.js\nimport 'react-app-polyfill/ie9';\nimport 'react-app-polyfill/stable';\n\n// ...\n```\n\nFor IE11:\n\n```js\n// These must be the first lines in src/index.js\nimport 'react-app-polyfill/ie11';\nimport 'react-app-polyfill/stable';\n\n// ...\n```"

        "path": "packages/react-dev-utils/README.md",
        "content": "# react-dev-utils\n\nThis package includes some utilities used by [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).<br>\nPlease refer to its documentation:\n\n- [Getting Started](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/getting-started) – How to create a new app.\n- [User Guide](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/) – How to develop apps bootstrapped with Create React App.\n\n## Usage in Create React App Projects\n\nThese utilities come by default with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app). **You don’t need to install it separately in Create React App projects.**\n\n## Usage Outside of Create React App\n\nIf you don’t use Create React App, or if you [ejected](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/available-scripts#npm-run-eject), you may keep using these utilities. Their development will be aligned with Create React App, so major versions of these utilities may come out relatively often. Feel free to fork or copy and paste them into your projects if you’d like to have more control over them, or feel free to use the old versions. Not all of them are React-specific, but we might make some of them more React-specific in the future.\n\n### Entry Points\n\nThere is no single entry point. You can only import individual top-level modules.\n\n#### `new InterpolateHtmlPlugin(htmlWebpackPlugin: HtmlWebpackPlugin, replacements: {[key:string]: string})`\n\nThis webpack plugin lets us interpolate custom variables into `index.html`.<br>\nIt works in tandem with [HtmlWebpackPlugin](https://github.com/ampedandwired/html-webpack-plugin) 2.x via its [events](https://github.com/ampedandwired/html-webpack-plugin#events).\n\n```js\nvar path = require('path');\nvar HtmlWebpackPlugin = require('html-webpack-plugin');\nvar InterpolateHtmlPlugin = require('react-dev-utils/InterpolateHtmlPlugin');\n\n// webpack config\nvar publicUrl = '/my-custom-url';\n\nmodule.exports = {\n  output: {\n    // ...\n    publicPath: publicUrl + '/',\n  },\n  // ...\n  plugins: [\n    // Generates an `index.html` file with the <script> injected.\n    new HtmlWebpackPlugin({\n      inject: true,\n      template: path.resolve('public/index.html'),\n    }),\n    // Makes the public URL available as %PUBLIC_URL% in index.html, e.g.:\n    // <link rel=\"icon\" href=\"%PUBLIC_URL%/favicon.ico\">\n    new InterpolateHtmlPlugin(HtmlWebpackPlugin, {\n      PUBLIC_URL: publicUrl,\n      // You can pass any key-value pairs, this was just an example.\n      // WHATEVER: 42 will replace %WHATEVER% with 42 in index.html.\n    }),\n    // ...\n  ],\n  // ...\n};\n```\n\n#### `new InlineChunkHtmlPlugin(htmlWebpackPlugin: HtmlWebpackPlugin, tests: Regex[])`\n\nThis webpack plugin inlines script chunks into `index.html`.<br>\nIt works in tandem with [HtmlWebpackPlugin](https://github.com/ampedandwired/html-webpack-plugin) 4.x.\n\n```js\nvar path = require('path');\nvar HtmlWebpackPlugin = require('html-webpack-plugin');\nvar InlineChunkHtmlPlugin = require('react-dev-utils/InlineChunkHtmlPlugin');\n\n// webpack config\nvar publicUrl = '/my-custom-url';\n\nmodule.exports = {\n  output: {\n    // ...\n    publicPath: publicUrl + '/',\n  },\n  // ...\n  plugins: [\n    // Generates an `index.html` file with the <script> injected.\n    new HtmlWebpackPlugin({\n      inject: true,\n      template: path.resolve('public/index.html'),\n    }),\n    // Inlines chunks with `runtime` in the name\n    new InlineChunkHtmlPlugin(HtmlWebpackPlugin, [/runtime/]),\n    // ...\n  ],\n  // ...\n};\n```\n\n#### `new ModuleScopePlugin(appSrc: string | string[], allowedFiles?: string[])`\n\nThis webpack plugin ensures that relative imports from app's source directories don't reach outside of it.\n\n```js\nvar path = require('path');\nvar ModuleScopePlugin = require('react-dev-utils/ModuleScopePlugin');\n\nmodule.exports = {\n  // ...\n  resolve: {\n    // ...\n    plugins: [\n      new ModuleScopePlugin(paths.appSrc, [paths.appPackageJson]),\n      // ...\n    ],\n    // ...\n  },\n  // ...\n};\n```\n\n#### `checkRequiredFiles(files: Array<string>): boolean`\n\nMakes sure that all passed files exist.<br>\nFilenames are expected to be absolute.<br>\nIf a file is not found, prints a warning message and returns `false`.\n\n```js\nvar path = require('path');\nvar checkRequiredFiles = require('react-dev-utils/checkRequiredFiles');\n\nif (\n  !checkRequiredFiles([\n    path.resolve('public/index.html'),\n    path.resolve('src/index.js'),\n  ])\n) {\n  process.exit(1);\n}\n```\n\n#### `clearConsole(): void`\n\nClears the console, hopefully in a cross-platform way.\n\n```js\nvar clearConsole = require('react-dev-utils/clearConsole');\n\nclearConsole();\nconsole.log('Just cleared the screen!');\n```\n\n#### `eslintFormatter(results: Object): string`\n\nThis is our custom ESLint formatter that integrates well with Create React App console output.<br>\nYou can use the default one instead if you prefer so.\n\n```js\nconst eslintFormatter = require('react-dev-utils/eslintFormatter');\n\n// In your webpack config:\n// ...\nmodule: {\n  rules: [\n    {\n      test: /\\.(js|jsx)$/,\n      include: paths.appSrc,\n      enforce: 'pre',\n      use: [\n        {\n          loader: 'eslint-loader',\n          options: {\n            // Pass the formatter:\n            formatter: eslintFormatter,\n          },\n        },\n      ],\n    },\n  ];\n}\n```\n\n#### `FileSizeReporter`\n\n##### `measureFileSizesBeforeBuild(buildFolder: string): Promise<OpaqueFileSizes>`\n\nCaptures JS and CSS asset sizes inside the passed `buildFolder`. Save the result value to compare it after the build.\n\n##### `printFileSizesAfterBuild(webpackStats: WebpackStats, previousFileSizes: OpaqueFileSizes, buildFolder: string, maxBundleGzipSize?: number, maxChunkGzipSize?: number)`\n\nPrints the JS and CSS asset sizes after the build, and includes a size comparison with `previousFileSizes` that were captured earlier using `measureFileSizesBeforeBuild()`. `maxBundleGzipSize` and `maxChunkGzipSizemay` may optionally be specified to display a warning when the main bundle or a chunk exceeds the specified size (in bytes).\n\n```js\nvar {\n  measureFileSizesBeforeBuild,\n  printFileSizesAfterBuild,\n} = require('react-dev-utils/FileSizeReporter');\n\nmeasureFileSizesBeforeBuild(buildFolder).then(previousFileSizes => {\n  return cleanAndRebuild().then(webpackStats => {\n    printFileSizesAfterBuild(webpackStats, previousFileSizes, buildFolder);\n  });\n});\n```\n\n#### `formatWebpackMessages({errors: Array<string>, warnings: Array<string>}): {errors: Array<string>, warnings: Array<string>}`\n\nExtracts and prettifies warning and error messages from webpack [stats](https://github.com/webpack/docs/wiki/node.js-api#stats) object.\n\n```js\nvar webpack = require('webpack');\nvar config = require('../config/webpack.config.dev');\nvar formatWebpackMessages = require('react-dev-utils/formatWebpackMessages');\n\nvar compiler = webpack(config);\n\ncompiler.hooks.invalid.tap('invalid', function () {\n  console.log('Compiling...');\n});\n\ncompiler.hooks.done.tap('done', function (stats) {\n  var rawMessages = stats.toJson({}, true);\n  var messages = formatWebpackMessages(rawMessages);\n  if (!messages.errors.length && !messages.warnings.length) {\n    console.log('Compiled successfully!');\n  }\n  if (messages.errors.length) {\n    console.log('Failed to compile.');\n    messages.errors.forEach(e => console.log(e));\n    return;\n  }\n  if (messages.warnings.length) {\n    console.log('Compiled with warnings.');\n    messages.warnings.forEach(w => console.log(w));\n  }\n});\n```\n\n#### `printBuildError(error: Object): void`\n\nPrettify some known build errors.\nPass an Error object to log a prettified error message in the console.\n\n```\n  const printBuildError = require('react-dev-utils/printBuildError')\n  try {\n    build()\n  } catch(e) {\n    printBuildError(e) // logs prettified message\n  }\n```\n\n#### `getProcessForPort(port: number): string`\n\nFinds the currently running process on `port`.\nReturns a string containing the name and directory, e.g.,\n\n```\ncreate-react-app\nin /Users/developer/create-react-app\n```\n\n```js\nvar getProcessForPort = require('react-dev-utils/getProcessForPort');\n\ngetProcessForPort(3000);\n```\n\n#### `launchEditor(fileName: string, lineNumber: number): void`\n\nOn macOS, tries to find a known running editor process and opens the file in it. It can also be explicitly configured by `REACT_EDITOR`, `VISUAL`, or `EDITOR` environment variables. For example, you can put `REACT_EDITOR=atom` in your `.env.local` file, and Create React App will respect that.\n\n#### `noopServiceWorkerMiddleware(servedPath: string): ExpressMiddleware`\n\nReturns Express middleware that serves a `${servedPath}/service-worker.js` that resets any previously set service worker configuration. Useful for development.\n\n#### `redirectServedPathMiddleware(servedPath: string): ExpressMiddleware`\n\nReturns Express middleware that redirects to `${servedPath}/${req.path}`, if `req.url`\ndoes not start with `servedPath`. Useful for development.\n\n#### `openBrowser(url: string): boolean`\n\nAttempts to open the browser with a given URL.<br>\nOn Mac OS X, attempts to reuse an existing Chrome tab via AppleScript.<br>\nOtherwise, falls back to [opn](https://github.com/sindresorhus/opn) behavior.\n\n```js\nvar path = require('path');\nvar openBrowser = require('react-dev-utils/openBrowser');\n\nif (openBrowser('http://localhost:3000')) {\n  console.log('The browser tab has been opened!');\n}\n```\n\n#### `printHostingInstructions(appPackage: Object, publicUrl: string, publicPath: string, buildFolder: string, useYarn: boolean): void`\n\nPrints hosting instructions after the project is built.\n\nPass your parsed `package.json` object as `appPackage`, your URL where you plan to host the app as `publicUrl`, `output.publicPath` from your webpack configuration as `publicPath`, the `buildFolder` name, and whether to `useYarn` in instructions.\n\n```js\nconst appPackage = require(paths.appPackageJson);\nconst publicUrl = paths.publicUrlOrPath;\nconst publicPath = config.output.publicPath;\nprintHostingInstructions(appPackage, publicUrl, publicPath, 'build', true);\n```\n\n#### `WebpackDevServerUtils`\n\n##### `choosePort(host: string, defaultPort: number): Promise<number | null>`\n\nReturns a Promise resolving to either `defaultPort` or next available port if the user confirms it is okay to do. If the port is taken and the user has refused to use another port, or if the terminal is not interactive and can’t present user with the choice, resolves to `null`.\n\n##### `createCompiler(args: Object): WebpackCompiler`\n\nCreates a webpack compiler instance for WebpackDevServer with built-in helpful messages.\n\nThe `args` object accepts a number of properties:\n\n- **appName** `string`: The name that will be printed to the terminal.\n- **config** `Object`: The webpack configuration options to be provided to the webpack constructor.\n- **urls** `Object`: To provide the `urls` argument, use `prepareUrls()` described below.\n- **useYarn** `boolean`: If `true`, yarn instructions will be emitted in the terminal instead of npm.\n- **useTypeScript** `boolean`: If `true`, TypeScript type checking will be enabled. Be sure to provide the `devSocket` argument above if this is set to `true`.\n- **webpack** `function`: A reference to the webpack constructor.\n\n##### `prepareProxy(proxySetting: string, appPublicFolder: string, servedPathname: string): Object`\n\nCreates a WebpackDevServer `proxy` configuration object from the `proxy` setting in `package.json`.\n\n##### `prepareUrls(protocol: string, host: string, port: number, pathname: string = '/'): Object`\n\nReturns an object with local and remote URLs for the development server. Pass this object to `createCompiler()` described above.\n\n#### `webpackHotDevClient`\n\nThis is an alternative client for [WebpackDevServer](https://github.com/webpack/webpack-dev-server) that shows a syntax error overlay.\n\nIt currently supports only webpack 3.x.\n\n```js\n// webpack development config\nmodule.exports = {\n  // ...\n  entry: [\n    // You can replace the line below with these two lines if you prefer the\n    // stock client:\n    // require.resolve('webpack-dev-server/client') + '?/',\n    // require.resolve('webpack/hot/dev-server'),\n    'react-dev-utils/webpackHotDevClient',\n    'src/index',\n  ],\n  // ...\n};\n```\n\n#### `getCSSModuleLocalIdent(context: Object, localIdentName: String, localName: String, options: Object): string`\n\nCreates a class name for CSS Modules that uses either the filename or folder name if named `index.module.css`.\n\nFor `MyFolder/MyComponent.module.css` and class `MyClass` the output will be `MyComponent.module_MyClass__[hash]`\nFor `MyFolder/index.module.css` and class `MyClass` the output will be `MyFolder_MyClass__[hash]`\n\n```js\nconst getCSSModuleLocalIdent = require('react-dev-utils/getCSSModuleLocalIdent');\n\n// In your webpack config:\n// ...\nmodule: {\n  rules: [\n    {\n      test: /\\.module\\.css$/,\n      use: [\n        require.resolve('style-loader'),\n        {\n          loader: require.resolve('css-loader'),\n          options: {\n            importLoaders: 1,\n            modules: {\n              getLocalIdent: getCSSModuleLocalIdent,\n            },\n          },\n        },\n        {\n          loader: require.resolve('postcss-loader'),\n          options: postCSSLoaderOptions,\n        },\n      ],\n    },\n  ];\n}\n```\n\n#### `getCacheIdentifier(environment: string, packages: string[]): string`\n\nReturns a cache identifier (string) consisting of the specified environment and related package versions, e.g.,\n\n```js\nvar getCacheIdentifier = require('react-dev-utils/getCacheIdentifier');\n\ngetCacheIdentifier('prod', ['react-dev-utils', 'chalk']); // # => 'prod:react-dev-utils@5.0.0:chalk@3.0.0'\n```"

The most common tests will be the webpack messages.<br>\nTo only run the webpack messages, type `p` followed by `webpack-message` and press `[enter]`.\n\n## How do these work?\n\n### `fixtures/`\n\nEach `fixture/` gets spun up in a temporary directory and has its dependencies installed with Yarn PnP (for speed).<br>\nTo opt-out of PnP, create a `.disable-pnp` file in the specific fixture directory.\n\nA global (`testSetup`) is created which has a few interesting properties:\n\n- `testSetup.testDirectory`: the directory containing the test application\n- `testSetup.scripts`: an object allowing you to invoke `react-scripts` commands and friends\n\nAll tests for each `fixture/` are then ran.\n\n#### `testSetup.scripts`\n\n##### `start`\n\nThis will run the `start` command, it can be ran asynchronously or blocking if `{ smoke: true }` is used.<br>\nIf ran asynchronously, it will return the `port` and a `done` function to clean up the process.\nIf ran blocking, it will return the `stdout` and `stderr` of the process.\n\n##### `build`\n\nThis will run the `build` command and return the `stdout` and `stderr` of the process.\n\n##### `test`\n\nThis will run the `test` command and return the `stdout` and `stderr` of the process.\n\n##### `serve`\n\nThis will run serve the application.\nIt will return the `port` and a `done` function to clean up the process."
